HISTORY.\n\nTHERE is one mind common to all individual men. Every man is an inlet to\nthe same and to all of the same. He that is once admitted to the right\nof reason is made a freeman of the whole estate. What Plato has thought,\nhe may think; what a saint has felt, he may feel; what at any time has\nbefallen any man, he can understand. Who hath access to this universal\nmind is a party to all that is or can be done, for this is the only and\nsovereign agent.\n\nOf the works of this mind history is the record. Its genius is\nillustrated by the entire series of days. Man is explicable by nothing\nless than all his history. Without hurry, without rest, the human spirit\ngoes forth from the beginning to embody every faculty, every thought,\nevery emotion, which belongs to it, in appropriate events. But the\nthought is always prior to the fact; all the facts of history preexist\nin the mind as laws. Each law in turn is made by circumstances\npredominant, and the limits of nature give power to but one at a time.\nA man is the whole encyclopaedia of facts. The creation of a thousand\nforests is in one acorn, and Egypt, Greece, Rome, Gaul, Britain,\nAmerica, lie folded already in the first man. Epoch after epoch, camp,\nkingdom, empire, republic, democracy, are merely the application of his\nmanifold spirit to the manifold world.\n\nThis human mind wrote history, and this must read it. The Sphinx must\nsolve her own riddle. If the whole of history is in one man, it is all\nto be explained from individual experience. There is a relation between\nthe hours of our life and the centuries of time. As the air I breathe is\ndrawn from the great repositories of nature, as the light on my book is\nyielded by a star a hundred millions of miles distant, as the poise\nof my body depends on the equilibrium of centrifugal and centripetal\nforces, so the hours should be instructed by the ages and the ages\nexplained by the hours. Of the universal mind each individual man is one\nmore incarnation. All its properties consist in him. Each new fact in\nhis private experience flashes a light on what great bodies of men\nhave done, and the crises of his life refer to national crises. Every\nrevolution was first a thought in one man's mind, and when the same\nthought occurs to another man, it is the key to that era. Every reform\nwas once a private opinion, and when it shall be a private opinion again\nit will solve the problem of the age. The fact narrated must correspond\nto something in me to be credible or intelligible. We, as we read, must\nbecome Greeks, Romans, Turks, priest and king, martyr and executioner;\nmust fasten these images to some reality in our secret experience, or we\nshall learn nothing rightly. What befell Asdrubal or Caesar Borgia is as\nmuch an illustration of the mind's powers and depravations as what has\nbefallen us. Each new law and political movement has meaning for you.\nStand before each of its tablets and say, 'Under this mask did my\nProteus nature hide itself.' This remedies the defect of our too great\nnearness to ourselves. This throws our actions into perspective; and\nas crabs, goats, scorpions, the balance and the waterpot lose their\nmeanness when hung as signs in the zodiac, so I can see my own vices\nwithout heat in the distant persons of Solomon, Alcibiades, and\nCatiline.\n\nIt is the universal nature which gives worth to particular men and\nthings. Human life, as containing this, is mysterious and inviolable,\nand we hedge it round with penalties and laws. All laws derive hence\ntheir ultimate reason; all express more or less distinctly some command\nof this supreme, illimitable essence. Property also holds of the soul,\ncovers great spiritual facts, and instinctively we at first hold to\nit with swords and laws and wide and complex combinations. The obscure\nconsciousness of this fact is the light of all our day, the claim of\nclaims; the plea for education, for justice, for charity; the foundation\nof friendship and love and of the heroism and grandeur which belong to\nacts of self-reliance. It is remarkable that involuntarily we always\nread as superior beings. Universal history, the poets, the romancers,\ndo not in their stateliest pictures,--in the sacerdotal, the imperial\npalaces, in the triumphs of will or of genius,--anywhere lose our ear,\nanywhere make us feel that we intrude, that this is for better men; but\nrather is it true that in their grandest strokes we feel most at home.\nAll that Shakspeare says of the king, yonder slip of a boy that reads\nin the corner feels to be true of himself. We sympathize in the great\nmoments of history, in the great discoveries, the great resistances, the\ngreat prosperities of men;--because there law was enacted, the sea was\nsearched, the land was found, or the blow was struck, for us, as we\nourselves in that place would have done or applauded.\n\nWe have the same interest in condition and character. We honor the rich\nbecause they have externally the freedom, power, and grace which we feel\nto be proper to man, proper to us. So all that is said of the wise man\nby Stoic or Oriental or modern essayist, describes to each reader his\nown idea, describes his unattained but attainable self. All literature\nwrites the character of the wise man. Books, monuments, pictures,\nconversation, are portraits in which he finds the lineaments he is\nforming. The silent and the eloquent praise him and accost him, and\nhe is stimulated wherever he moves, as by personal allusions. A true\naspirant therefore never needs look for allusions personal and laudatory\nin discourse. He hears the commendation, not of himself, but, more\nsweet, of that character he seeks, in every word that is said concerning\ncharacter, yea further in every fact and circumstance,--in the running\nriver and the rustling corn. Praise is looked, homage tendered, love\nflows, from mute nature, from the mountains and the lights of the\nfirmament.\n\nThese hints, dropped as it were from sleep and night, let us use in\nbroad day. The student is to read history actively and not passively; to\nesteem his own life the text, and books the commentary. Thus compelled,\nthe Muse of history will utter oracles, as never to those who do not\nrespect themselves. I have no expectation that any man will read history\naright who thinks that what was done in a remote age, by men whose names\nhave resounded far, has any deeper sense than what he is doing to-day.\n\nThe world exists for the education of each man. There is no age or state\nof society or mode of action in history to which there is not somewhat\ncorresponding in his life. Every thing tends in a wonderful manner to\nabbreviate itself and yield its own virtue to him. He should see that he\ncan live all history in his own person. He must sit solidly at home, and\nnot suffer himself to be bullied by kings or empires, but know that he\nis greater than all the geography and all the government of the world;\nhe must transfer the point of view from which history is commonly read,\nfrom Rome and Athens and London, to himself, and not deny his conviction\nthat he is the court, and if England or Egypt have any thing to say to\nhim he will try the case; if not, let them for ever be silent. He must\nattain and maintain that lofty sight where facts yield their secret\nsense, and poetry and annals are alike. The instinct of the mind, the\npurpose of nature, betrays itself in the use we make of the signal\nnarrations of history. Time dissipates to shining ether the solid\nangularity of facts. No anchor, no cable, no fences avail to keep a fact\na fact. Babylon, Troy, Tyre, Palestine, and even early Rome are passing\nalready into fiction. The Garden of Eden, the sun standing still in\nGibeon, is poetry thenceforward to all nations. Who cares what the\nfact was, when we have made a constellation of it to hang in heaven an\nimmortal sign? London and Paris and New York must go the same way. \"What\nis history,\" said Napoleon, \"but a fable agreed upon?\" This life of ours\nis stuck round with Egypt, Greece, Gaul, England, War, Colonization,\nChurch, Court and Commerce, as with so many flowers and wild ornaments\ngrave and gay. I will not make more account of them. I believe in\nEternity. I can find Greece, Asia, Italy, Spain and the Islands,--the\ngenius and creative principle of each and of all eras, in my own mind.\n\nWe are always coming up with the emphatic facts of history in our\nprivate experience and verifying them here. All history becomes\nsubjective; in other words there is properly no history, only biography.\nEvery mind must know the whole lesson for itself,--must go over the\nwhole ground. What it does not see, what it does not live, it will not\nknow. What the former age has epitomized into a formula or rule for\nmanipular convenience, it will lose all the good of verifying for\nitself, by means of the wall of that rule. Somewhere, sometime, it will\ndemand and find compensation for that loss, by doing the work itself.\nFerguson discovered many things in astronomy which had long been known.\nThe better for him.\n\nHistory must be this or it is nothing. Every law which the state enacts\nindicates a fact in human nature; that is all. We must in ourselves see\nthe necessary reason of every fact,--see how it could and must be. So\nstand before every public and private work; before an oration of Burke,\nbefore a victory of Napoleon, before a martyrdom of Sir Thomas More, of\nSidney, of Marmaduke Robinson; before a French Reign of Terror, and\na Salem hanging of witches; before a fanatic Revival and the Animal\nMagnetism in Paris, or in Providence. We assume that we under like\ninfluence should be alike affected, and should achieve the like; and we\naim to master intellectually the steps and reach the same height or the\nsame degradation that our fellow, our proxy has done.\n\nAll inquiry into antiquity, all curiosity respecting the Pyramids, the\nexcavated cities, Stonehenge, the Ohio Circles, Mexico, Memphis,--is the\ndesire to do away this wild, savage, and preposterous There or Then, and\nintroduce in its place the Here and the Now. Belzoni digs and measures\nin the mummy-pits and pyramids of Thebes, until he can see the end\nof the difference between the monstrous work and himself. When he has\nsatisfied himself, in general and in detail, that it was made by such a\nperson as he, so armed and so motived, and to ends to which he himself\nshould also have worked, the problem is solved; his thought lives along\nthe whole line of temples and sphinxes and catacombs, passes through\nthem all with satisfaction, and they live again to the mind, or are now.\n\nA Gothic cathedral affirms that it was done by us and not done by\nus. Surely it was by man, but we find it not in our man. But we apply\nourselves to the history of its production. We put ourselves into the\nplace and state of the builder. We remember the forest-dwellers, the\nfirst temples, the adherence to the first type, and the decoration of it\nas the wealth of the nation increased; the value which is given to wood\nby carving led to the carving over the whole mountain of stone of a\ncathedral. When we have gone through this process, and added thereto the\nCatholic Church, its cross, its music, its processions, its Saints'\ndays and image-worship, we have as it were been the man that made the\nminster; we have seen how it could and must be. We have the sufficient\nreason.\n\nThe difference between men is in their principle of association.\nSome men classify objects by color and size and other accidents of\nappearance; others by intrinsic likeness, or by the relation of cause\nand effect. The progress of the intellect is to the clearer vision\nof causes, which neglects surface differences. To the poet, to the\nphilosopher, to the saint, all things are friendly and sacred, all\nevents profitable, all days holy, all men divine. For the eye is\nfastened on the life, and slights the circumstance. Every chemical\nsubstance, every plant, every animal in its growth, teaches the unity of\ncause, the variety of appearance.\n\nUpborne and surrounded as we are by this all-creating nature, soft and\nfluid as a cloud or the air, why should we be such hard pedants,\nand magnify a few forms? Why should we make account of time, or of\nmagnitude, or of figure? The soul knows them not, and genius, obeying\nits law, knows how to play with them as a young child plays with\ngraybeards and in churches. Genius studies the causal thought, and far\nback in the womb of things sees the rays parting from one orb, that\ndiverge, ere they fall, by infinite diameters. Genius watches the monad\nthrough all his masks as he performs the metempsychosis of nature.\nGenius detects through the fly, through the caterpillar, through the\ngrub, through the egg, the constant individual; through countless\nindividuals the fixed species; through many species the genus; through\nall genera the steadfast type; through all the kingdoms of organized\nlife the eternal unity. Nature is a mutable cloud which is always and\nnever the same. She casts the same thought into troops of forms, as\na poet makes twenty fables with one moral. Through the bruteness and\ntoughness of matter, a subtle spirit bends all things to its own will.\nThe adamant streams into soft but precise form before it, and whilst\nI look at it its outline and texture are changed again. Nothing is so\nfleeting as form; yet never does it quite deny itself. In man we still\ntrace the remains or hints of all that we esteem badges of servitude in\nthe lower races; yet in him they enhance his nobleness and grace; as\nIo, in Aeschylus, transformed to a cow, offends the imagination; but how\nchanged when as Isis in Egypt she meets Osiris-Jove, a beautiful woman\nwith nothing of the metamorphosis left but the lunar horns as the\nsplendid ornament of her brows!\n\nThe identity of history is equally intrinsic, the diversity equally\nobvious. There is, at the surface, infinite variety of things; at the\ncentre there is simplicity of cause. How many are the acts of one man\nin which we recognize the same character! Observe the sources of our\ninformation in respect to the Greek genius. We have the civil history of\nthat people, as Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, and Plutarch have given\nit; a very sufficient account of what manner of persons they were and\nwhat they did. We have the same national mind expressed for us again in\ntheir literature, in epic and lyric poems, drama, and philosophy; a very\ncomplete form. Then we have it once more in their architecture, a beauty\nas of temperance itself, limited to the straight line and the square,--a\nbuilded geometry. Then we have it once again in sculpture, the \"tongue\non the balance of expression,\" a multitude of forms in the utmost\nfreedom of action and never transgressing the ideal serenity; like\nvotaries performing some religious dance before the gods, and, though in\nconvulsive pain or mortal combat, never daring to break the figure and\ndecorum of their dance. Thus of the genius of one remarkable people we\nhave a fourfold representation: and to the senses what more unlike than\nan ode of Pindar, a marble centaur, the peristyle of the Parthenon, and\nthe last actions of Phocion?\n\nEvery one must have observed faces and forms which, without any\nresembling feature, make a like impression on the beholder. A particular\npicture or copy of verses, if it do not awaken the same train of images,\nwill yet superinduce the same sentiment as some wild mountain walk,\nalthough the resemblance is nowise obvious to the senses, but is\noccult and out of the reach of the understanding. Nature is an endless\ncombination and repetition of a very few laws. She hums the old\nwell-known air through innumerable variations.\n\nNature is full of a sublime family likeness throughout her works,\nand delights in startling us with resemblances in the most unexpected\nquarters. I have seen the head of an old sachem of the forest which at\nonce reminded the eye of a bald mountain summit, and the furrows of the\nbrow suggested the strata of the rock. There are men whose manners have\nthe same essential splendor as the simple and awful sculpture on the\nfriezes of the Parthenon and the remains of the earliest Greek art. And\nthere are compositions of the same strain to be found in the books of\nall ages. What is Guido's Rospigliosi Aurora but a morning thought,\nas the horses in it are only a morning cloud? If any one will but take\npains to observe the variety of actions to which he is equally inclined\nin certain moods of mind, and those to which he is averse, he will see\nhow deep is the chain of affinity.\n\nA painter told me that nobody could draw a tree without in some sort\nbecoming a tree; or draw a child by studying the outlines of its form\nmerely,--but, by watching for a time his motions and plays, the painter\nenters into his nature and can then draw him at will in every\nattitude. So Roos \"entered into the inmost nature of a sheep.\" I knew\na draughtsman employed in a public survey who found that he could not\nsketch the rocks until their geological structure was first explained to\nhim. In a certain state of thought is the common origin of very diverse\nworks. It is the spirit and not the fact that is identical. By a deeper\napprehension, and not primarily by a painful acquisition of many manual\nskills, the artist attains the power of awakening other souls to a given\nactivity.\n\nIt has been said that \"common souls pay with what they do, nobler souls\nwith that which they are.\" And why? Because a profound nature awakens\nin us by its actions and words, by its very looks and manners, the same\npower and beauty that a gallery of sculpture or of pictures addresses.\n\nCivil and natural history, the history of art and of literature, must\nbe explained from individual history, or must remain words. There\nis nothing but is related to us, nothing that does not interest\nus,--kingdom, college, tree, horse, or iron shoe,--the roots of all\nthings are in man. Santa Croce and the Dome of St. Peter's are\nlame copies after a divine model. Strasburg Cathedral is a material\ncounterpart of the soul of Erwin of Steinbach. The true poem is the\npoet's mind; the true ship is the ship-builder. In the man, could we lay\nhim open, we should see the reason for the last flourish and tendril\nof his work; as every spine and tint in the sea-shell preexists in the\nsecreting organs of the fish. The whole of heraldry and of chivalry is\nin courtesy. A man of fine manners shall pronounce your name with all\nthe ornament that titles of nobility could ever add.\n\nThe trivial experience of every day is always verifying some old\nprediction to us and converting into things the words and signs which\nwe had heard and seen without heed. A lady with whom I was riding in the\nforest said to me that the woods always seemed to her to wait, as if\nthe genii who inhabit them suspended their deeds until the wayfarer had\npassed onward; a thought which poetry has celebrated in the dance of the\nfairies, which breaks off on the approach of human feet. The man who\nhas seen the rising moon break out of the clouds at midnight, has been\npresent like an archangel at the creation of light and of the world. I\nremember one summer day in the fields my companion pointed out to me\na broad cloud, which might extend a quarter of a mile parallel to\nthe horizon, quite accurately in the form of a cherub as painted over\nchurches,--a round block in the centre, which it was easy to animate\nwith eyes and mouth, supported on either side by wide-stretched\nsymmetrical wings. What appears once in the atmosphere may appear often,\nand it was undoubtedly the archetype of that familiar ornament. I have\nseen in the sky a chain of summer lightning which at once showed to me\nthat the Greeks drew from nature when they painted the thunderbolt in\nthe hand of Jove. I have seen a snow-drift along the sides of the stone\nwall which obviously gave the idea of the common architectural scroll to\nabut a tower.\n\nBy surrounding ourselves with the original circumstances we invent anew\nthe orders and the ornaments of architecture, as we see how each people\nmerely decorated its primitive abodes. The Doric temple preserves the\nsemblance of the wooden cabin in which the Dorian dwelt. The Chinese\npagoda is plainly a Tartar tent. The Indian and Egyptian temples still\nbetray the mounds and subterranean houses of their forefathers. \"The\ncustom of making houses and tombs in the living rock,\" says Heeren\nin his Researches on the Ethiopians, \"determined very naturally the\nprincipal character of the Nubian Egyptian architecture to the colossal\nform which it assumed. In these caverns, already prepared by nature, the\neye was accustomed to dwell on huge shapes and masses, so that when\nart came to the assistance of nature it could not move on a small scale\nwithout degrading itself. What would statues of the usual size, or neat\nporches and wings have been, associated with those gigantic halls before\nwhich only Colossi could sit as watchmen or lean on the pillars of the\ninterior?\"\n\nThe Gothic church plainly originated in a rude adaptation of the forest\ntrees, with all their boughs, to a festal or solemn arcade; as the bands\nabout the cleft pillars still indicate the green withes that tied them.\nNo one can walk in a road cut through pine woods, without being struck\nwith the architectural appearance of the grove, especially in winter,\nwhen the barrenness of all other trees shows the low arch of the Saxons.\nIn the woods in a winter afternoon one will see as readily the origin of\nthe stained glass window, with which the Gothic cathedrals are adorned,\nin the colors of the western sky seen through the bare and crossing\nbranches of the forest. Nor can any lover of nature enter the old piles\nof Oxford and the English cathedrals, without feeling that the forest\noverpowered the mind of the builder, and that his chisel, his saw and\nplane still reproduced its ferns, its spikes of flowers, its locust,\nelm, oak, pine, fir and spruce.\n\nThe Gothic cathedral is a blossoming in stone subdued by the insatiable\ndemand of harmony in man. The mountain of granite blooms into an eternal\nflower, with the lightness and delicate finish as well as the aerial\nproportions and perspective of vegetable beauty.\n\nIn like manner all public facts are to be individualized, all private\nfacts are to be generalized. Then at once History becomes fluid and\ntrue, and Biography deep and sublime. As the Persian imitated in the\nslender shafts and capitals of his architecture the stem and flower of\nthe lotus and palm, so the Persian court in its magnificent era never\ngave over the nomadism of its barbarous tribes, but travelled from\nEcbatana, where the spring was spent, to Susa in summer and to Babylon\nfor the winter.\n\nIn the early history of Asia and Africa, Nomadism and Agriculture\nare the two antagonist facts. The geography of Asia and of Africa\nnecessitated a nomadic life. But the nomads were the terror of all those\nwhom the soil or the advantages of a market had induced to build towns.\nAgriculture therefore was a religious injunction, because of the perils\nof the state from nomadism. And in these late and civil countries of\nEngland and America these propensities still fight out the old\nbattle, in the nation and in the individual. The nomads of Africa were\nconstrained to wander, by the attacks of the gad-fly, which drives the\ncattle mad, and so compels the tribe to emigrate in the rainy season and\nto drive off the cattle to the higher sandy regions. The nomads of Asia\nfollow the pasturage from month to month. In America and Europe the\nnomadism is of trade and curiosity; a progress, certainly, from the\ngad-fly of Astaboras to the Anglo and Italo-mania of Boston Bay. Sacred\ncities, to which a periodical religious pilgrimage was enjoined, or\nstringent laws and customs, tending to invigorate the national bond,\nwere the check on the old rovers; and the cumulative values of long\nresidence are the restraints on the itineracy of the present day. The\nantagonism of the two tendencies is not less active in individuals, as\nthe love of adventure or the love of repose happens to predominate.\nA man of rude health and flowing spirits has the faculty of rapid\ndomestication, lives in his wagon and roams through all latitudes as\neasily as a Calmuc. At sea, or in the forest, or in the snow, he sleeps\nas warm, dines with as good appetite, and associates as happily as\nbeside his own chimneys. Or perhaps his facility is deeper seated, in\nthe increased range of his faculties of observation, which yield him\npoints of interest wherever fresh objects meet his eyes. The pastoral\nnations were needy and hungry to desperation; and this intellectual\nnomadism, in its excess, bankrupts the mind through the dissipation of\npower on a miscellany of objects. The home-keeping wit, on the other\nhand, is that continence or content which finds all the elements of\nlife in its own soil; and which has its own perils of monotony and\ndeterioration, if not stimulated by foreign infusions.\n\nEvery thing the individual sees without him corresponds to his states\nof mind, and every thing is in turn intelligible to him, as his onward\nthinking leads him into the truth to which that fact or series belongs.\n\nThe primeval world,--the Fore-World, as the Germans say,--I can dive\nto it in myself as well as grope for it with researching fingers in\ncatacombs, libraries, and the broken reliefs and torsos of ruined\nvillas.\n\nWhat is the foundation of that interest all men feel in Greek history,\nletters, art, and poetry, in all its periods from the Heroic or Homeric\nage down to the domestic life of the Athenians and Spartans, four or\nfive centuries later? What but this, that every man passes personally\nthrough a Grecian period. The Grecian state is the era of the bodily\nnature, the perfection of the senses,--of the spiritual nature unfolded\nin strict unity with the body. In it existed those human forms which\nsupplied the sculptor with his models of Hercules, Phoebus, and Jove;\nnot like the forms abounding in the streets of modern cities, wherein\nthe face is a confused blur of features, but composed of incorrupt,\nsharply defined and symmetrical features, whose eye-sockets are so\nformed that it would be impossible for such eyes to squint and take\nfurtive glances on this side and on that, but they must turn the whole\nhead. The manners of that period are plain and fierce. The reverence\nexhibited is for personal qualities; courage, address, self-command,\njustice, strength, swiftness, a loud voice, a broad chest. Luxury and\nelegance are not known. A sparse population and want make every man his\nown valet, cook, butcher and soldier, and the habit of supplying his\nown needs educates the body to wonderful performances. Such are the\nAgamemnon and Diomed of Homer, and not far different is the picture\nXenophon gives of himself and his compatriots in the Retreat of the Ten\nThousand. \"After the army had crossed the river Teleboas in Armenia,\nthere fell much snow, and the troops lay miserably on the ground covered\nwith it. But Xenophon arose naked, and taking an axe, began to split\nwood; whereupon others rose and did the like.\" Throughout his army\nexists a boundless liberty of speech. They quarrel for plunder,\nthey wrangle with the generals on each new order, and Xenophon is as\nsharp-tongued as any and sharper-tongued than most, and so gives as good\nas he gets. Who does not see that this is a gang of great boys, with\nsuch a code of honor and such lax discipline as great boys have?\n\nThe costly charm of the ancient tragedy, and indeed of all the old\nliterature, is that the persons speak simply,--speak as persons who have\ngreat good sense without knowing it, before yet the reflective habit has\nbecome the predominant habit of the mind. Our admiration of the antique\nis not admiration of the old, but of the natural. The Greeks are not\nreflective, but perfect in their senses and in their health, with\nthe finest physical organization in the world. Adults acted with the\nsimplicity and grace of children. They made vases, tragedies, and\nstatues, such as healthy senses should,--that is, in good taste. Such\nthings have continued to be made in all ages, and are now, wherever\na healthy physique exists; but, as a class, from their superior\norganization, they have surpassed all. They combine the energy of\nmanhood with the engaging unconsciousness of childhood. The attraction\nof these manners is that they belong to man, and are known to every\nman in virtue of his being once a child; besides that there are always\nindividuals who retain these characteristics. A person of childlike\ngenius and inborn energy is still a Greek, and revives our love of\nthe Muse of Hellas. I admire the love of nature in the Philoctetes. In\nreading those fine apostrophes to sleep, to the stars, rocks, mountains\nand waves, I feel time passing away as an ebbing sea. I feel the\neternity of man, the identity of his thought. The Greek had it seems the\nsame fellow-beings as I. The sun and moon, water and fire, met his heart\nprecisely as they meet mine. Then the vaunted distinction between Greek\nand English, between Classic and Romantic schools, seems superficial and\npedantic. When a thought of Plato becomes a thought to me,--when a truth\nthat fired the soul of Pindar fires mine, time is no more. When I feel\nthat we two meet in a perception, that our two souls are tinged with the\nsame hue, and do as it were run into one, why should I measure degrees\nof latitude, why should I count Egyptian years?\n\nThe student interprets the age of chivalry by his own age of chivalry,\nand the days of maritime adventure and circumnavigation by quite\nparallel miniature experiences of his own. To the sacred history of the\nworld he has the same key. When the voice of a prophet out of the deeps\nof antiquity merely echoes to him a sentiment of his infancy, a prayer\nof his youth, he then pierces to the truth through all the confusion of\ntradition and the caricature of institutions.\n\nRare, extravagant spirits come by us at intervals, who disclose to us\nnew facts in nature. I see that men of God have from time to time walked\namong men and made their commission felt in the heart and soul of the\ncommonest hearer. Hence evidently the tripod, the priest, the priestess\ninspired by the divine afflatus.\n\nJesus astonishes and overpowers sensual people. They cannot unite him to\nhistory, or reconcile him with themselves. As they come to revere their\nintuitions and aspire to live holily, their own piety explains every\nfact, every word.\n\nHow easily these old worships of Moses, of Zoroaster, of Menu, of\nSocrates, domesticate themselves in the mind. I cannot find any\nantiquity in them. They are mine as much as theirs.\n\nI have seen the first monks and anchorets, without crossing seas or\ncenturies. More than once some individual has appeared to me with\nsuch negligence of labor and such commanding contemplation, a haughty\nbeneficiary begging in the name of God, as made good to the nineteenth\ncentury Simeon the Stylite, the Thebais, and the first Capuchins.\n\nThe priestcraft of the East and West, of the Magian, Brahmin, Druid,\nand Inca, is expounded in the individual's private life. The cramping\ninfluence of a hard formalist on a young child, in repressing his\nspirits and courage, paralyzing the understanding, and that without\nproducing indignation, but only fear and obedience, and even much\nsympathy with the tyranny,--is a familiar fact, explained to the child\nwhen he becomes a man, only by seeing that the oppressor of his youth\nis himself a child tyrannized over by those names and words and forms of\nwhose influence he was merely the organ to the youth. The fact teaches\nhim how Belus was worshipped and how the Pyramids were built, better\nthan the discovery by Champollion of the names of all the workmen and\nthe cost of every tile. He finds Assyria and the Mounds of Cholula at\nhis door, and himself has laid the courses.\n\nAgain, in that protest which each considerate person makes against the\nsuperstition of his times, he repeats step for step the part of old\nreformers, and in the search after truth finds, like them, new perils to\nvirtue. He learns again what moral vigor is needed to supply the girdle\nof a superstition. A great licentiousness treads on the heels of a\nreformation. How many times in the history of the world has the Luther\nof the day had to lament the decay of piety in his own household!\n\"Doctor,\" said his wife to Martin Luther, one day, \"how is it that\nwhilst subject to papacy we prayed so often and with such fervor, whilst\nnow we pray with the utmost coldness and very seldom?\"\n\nThe advancing man discovers how deep a property he has in\nliterature,--in all fable as well as in all history. He finds that the\npoet was no odd fellow who described strange and impossible situations,\nbut that universal man wrote by his pen a confession true for one and\ntrue for all. His own secret biography he finds in lines wonderfully\nintelligible to him, dotted down before he was born. One after another\nhe comes up in his private adventures with every fable of Aesop, of\nHomer, of Hafiz, of Ariosto, of Chaucer, of Scott, and verifies them\nwith his own head and hands.\n\nThe beautiful fables of the Greeks, being proper creations of the\nimagination and not of the fancy, are universal verities. What a range\nof meanings and what perpetual pertinence has the story of Prometheus!\nBeside its primary value as the first chapter of the history of Europe,\n(the mythology thinly veiling authentic facts, the invention of the\nmechanic arts and the migration of colonies,) it gives the history of\nreligion, with some closeness to the faith of later ages. Prometheus is\nthe Jesus of the old mythology. He is the friend of man; stands between\nthe unjust \"justice\" of the Eternal Father and the race of mortals, and\nreadily suffers all things on their account. But where it departs from\nthe Calvinistic Christianity and exhibits him as the defier of Jove, it\nrepresents a state of mind which readily appears wherever the doctrine\nof Theism is taught in a crude, objective form, and which seems the\nself-defence of man against this untruth, namely a discontent with the\nbelieved fact that a God exists, and a feeling that the obligation\nof reverence is onerous. It would steal if it could the fire of the\nCreator, and live apart from him and independent of him. The Prometheus\nVinctus is the romance of skepticism. Not less true to all time are the\ndetails of that stately apologue. Apollo kept the flocks of Admetus,\nsaid the poets. When the gods come among men, they are not known. Jesus\nwas not; Socrates and Shakspeare were not. Antaeus was suffocated by\nthe gripe of Hercules, but every time he touched his mother earth his\nstrength was renewed. Man is the broken giant, and in all his weakness\nboth his body and his mind are invigorated by habits of conversation\nwith nature. The power of music, the power of poetry, to unfix and as it\nwere clap wings to solid nature, interprets the riddle of Orpheus. The\nphilosophical perception of identity through endless mutations of\nform makes him know the Proteus. What else am I who laughed or wept\nyesterday, who slept last night like a corpse, and this morning stood\nand ran? And what see I on any side but the transmigrations of Proteus?\nI can symbolize my thought by using the name of any creature, of any\nfact, because every creature is man agent or patient. Tantalus is but\na name for you and me. Tantalus means the impossibility of drinking the\nwaters of thought which are always gleaming and waving within sight of\nthe soul. The transmigration of souls is no fable. I would it were; but\nmen and women are only half human. Every animal of the barn-yard, the\nfield and the forest, of the earth and of the waters that are under\nthe earth, has contrived to get a footing and to leave the print of its\nfeatures and form in some one or other of these upright, heaven-facing\nspeakers. Ah! brother, stop the ebb of thy soul,--ebbing downward into\nthe forms into whose habits thou hast now for many years slid. As near\nand proper to us is also that old fable of the Sphinx, who was said\nto sit in the road-side and put riddles to every passenger. If the man\ncould not answer, she swallowed him alive. If he could solve the riddle,\nthe Sphinx was slain. What is our life but an endless flight of winged\nfacts or events? In splendid variety these changes come, all putting\nquestions to the human spirit. Those men who cannot answer by a superior\nwisdom these facts or questions of time, serve them. Facts encumber\nthem, tyrannize over them, and make the men of routine, the men of\nsense, in whom a literal obedience to facts has extinguished every spark\nof that light by which man is truly man. But if the man is true to his\nbetter instincts or sentiments, and refuses the dominion of facts, as\none that comes of a higher race; remains fast by the soul and sees the\nprinciple, then the facts fall aptly and supple into their places; they\nknow their master, and the meanest of them glorifies him.\n\nSee in Goethe's Helena the same desire that every word should be a\nthing. These figures, he would say, these Chirons, Griffins, Phorkyas,\nHelen and Leda, are somewhat, and do exert a specific influence on the\nmind. So far then are they eternal entities, as real to-day as in the\nfirst Olympiad. Much revolving them he writes out freely his humor, and\ngives them body to his own imagination. And although that poem be as\nvague and fantastic as a dream, yet is it much more attractive than the\nmore regular dramatic pieces of the same author, for the reason that it\noperates a wonderful relief to the mind from the routine of customary\nimages,--awakens the reader's invention and fancy by the wild freedom of\nthe design, and by the unceasing succession of brisk shocks of surprise.\n\nThe universal nature, too strong for the petty nature of the bard, sits\non his neck and writes through his hand; so that when he seems to vent\na mere caprice and wild romance, the issue is an exact allegory. Hence\nPlato said that \"poets utter great and wise things which they do not\nthemselves understand.\" All the fictions of the Middle Age explain\nthemselves as a masked or frolic expression of that which in grave\nearnest the mind of that period toiled to achieve. Magic and all that\nis ascribed to it is a deep presentiment of the powers of science. The\nshoes of swiftness, the sword of sharpness, the power of subduing the\nelements, of using the secret virtues of minerals, of understanding\nthe voices of birds, are the obscure efforts of the mind in a right\ndirection. The preternatural prowess of the hero, the gift of perpetual\nyouth, and the like, are alike the endeavour of the human spirit \"to\nbend the shows of things to the desires of the mind.\"\n\nIn Perceforest and Amadis de Gaul a garland and a rose bloom on the head\nof her who is faithful, and fade on the brow of the inconstant. In the\nstory of the Boy and the Mantle even a mature reader may be surprised\nwith a glow of virtuous pleasure at the triumph of the gentle Venelas;\nand indeed all the postulates of elfin annals,--that the fairies do not\nlike to be named; that their gifts are capricious and not to be trusted;\nthat who seeks a treasure must not speak; and the like,--I find true in\nConcord, however they might be in Cornwall or Bretagne.\n\nIs it otherwise in the newest romance? I read the Bride of Lammermoor.\nSir William Ashton is a mask for a vulgar temptation, Ravenswood Castle\na fine name for proud poverty, and the foreign mission of state only a\nBunyan disguise for honest industry. We may all shoot a wild bull that\nwould toss the good and beautiful, by fighting down the unjust and\nsensual. Lucy Ashton is another name for fidelity, which is always\nbeautiful and always liable to calamity in this world.\n\n\n\nBut along with the civil and metaphysical history of man, another\nhistory goes daily forward,--that of the external world,--in which he is\nnot less strictly implicated. He is the compend of time; he is also\nthe correlative of nature. His power consists in the multitude of his\naffinities, in the fact that his life is intertwined with the whole\nchain of organic and inorganic being. In old Rome the public roads\nbeginning at the Forum proceeded north, south, east, west, to the centre\nof every province of the empire, making each market-town of Persia,\nSpain and Britain pervious to the soldiers of the capital: so out of\nthe human heart go as it were highways to the heart of every object in\nnature, to reduce it under the dominion of man. A man is a bundle of\nrelations, a knot of roots, whose flower and fruitage is the world. His\nfaculties refer to natures out of him and predict the world he is to\ninhabit, as the fins of the fish foreshow that water exists, or the\nwings of an eagle in the egg presuppose air. He cannot live without a\nworld. Put Napoleon in an island prison, let his faculties find no men\nto act on, no Alps to climb, no stake to play for, and he would beat\nthe air, and appear stupid. Transport him to large countries, dense\npopulation, complex interests and antagonist power, and you shall see\nthat the man Napoleon, bounded that is by such a profile and outline, is\nnot the virtual Napoleon. This is but Talbot's shadow;--\n\n     \"His substance is not here.\n     For what you see is but the smallest part\n     And least proportion of humanity;\n     But were the whole frame here,\n     It is of such a spacious, lofty pitch,\n     Your roof were not sufficient to contain it.\"\n     --Henry VI.\n\nColumbus needs a planet to shape his course upon. Newton and Laplace\nneed myriads of age and thick-strewn celestial areas. One may say a\ngravitating solar system is already prophesied in the nature of Newton's\nmind. Not less does the brain of Davy or of Gay-Lussac, from childhood\nexploring the affinities and repulsions of particles, anticipate the\nlaws of organization. Does not the eye of the human embryo predict the\nlight? the ear of Handel predict the witchcraft of harmonic sound? Do\nnot the constructive fingers of Watt, Fulton, Whittemore, Arkwright,\npredict the fusible, hard, and temperable texture of metals, the\nproperties of stone, water, and wood? Do not the lovely attributes\nof the maiden child predict the refinements and decorations of civil\nsociety? Here also we are reminded of the action of man on man. A mind\nmight ponder its thought for ages and not gain so much self-knowledge as\nthe passion of love shall teach it in a day. Who knows himself before\nhe has been thrilled with indignation at an outrage, or has heard an\neloquent tongue, or has shared the throb of thousands in a national\nexultation or alarm? No man can antedate his experience, or guess what\nfaculty or feeling a new object shall unlock, any more than he can draw\nto-day the face of a person whom he shall see to-morrow for the first\ntime.\n\nI will not now go behind the general statement to explore the reason\nof this correspondency. Let it suffice that in the light of these two\nfacts, namely, that the mind is One, and that nature is its correlative,\nhistory is to be read and written.\n\nThus in all ways does the soul concentrate and reproduce its treasures\nfor each pupil. He too shall pass through the whole cycle of experience.\nHe shall collect into a focus the rays of nature. History no longer\nshall be a dull book. It shall walk incarnate in every just and wise\nman. You shall not tell me by languages and titles a catalogue of the\nvolumes you have read. You shall make me feel what periods you have\nlived. A man shall be the Temple of Fame. He shall walk, as the poets\nhave described that goddess, in a robe painted all over with wonderful\nevents and experiences;--his own form and features by their exalted\nintelligence shall be that variegated vest. I shall find in him the\nForeworld; in his childhood the Age of Gold, the Apples of Knowledge,\nthe Argonautic Expedition, the calling of Abraham, the building of the\nTemple, the Advent of Christ, Dark Ages, the Revival of Letters, the\nReformation, the discovery of new lands, the opening of new sciences and\nnew regions in man. He shall be the priest of Pan, and bring with him\ninto humble cottages the blessing of the morning stars, and all the\nrecorded benefits of heaven and earth.\n\nIs there somewhat overweening in this claim? Then I reject all I have\nwritten, for what is the use of pretending to know what we know not? But\nit is the fault of our rhetoric that we cannot strongly state one fact\nwithout seeming to belie some other. I hold our actual knowledge very\ncheap. Hear the rats in the wall, see the lizard on the fence,\nthe fungus under foot, the lichen on the log. What do I know\nsympathetically, morally, of either of these worlds of life? As old\nas the Caucasian man,--perhaps older,--these creatures have kept their\ncounsel beside him, and there is no record of any word or sign that has\npassed from one to the other. What connection do the books show between\nthe fifty or sixty chemical elements and the historical eras? Nay, what\ndoes history yet record of the metaphysical annals of man? What light\ndoes it shed on those mysteries which we hide under the names Death\nand Immortality? Yet every history should be written in a wisdom which\ndivined the range of our affinities and looked at facts as symbols. I am\nashamed to see what a shallow village tale our so-called History is. How\nmany times we must say Rome, and Paris, and Constantinople! What does\nRome know of rat and lizard? What are Olympiads and Consulates to these\nneighboring systems of being? Nay, what food or experience or succor\nhave they for the Esquimaux seal-hunter, for the Kanaka in his canoe,\nfor the fisherman, the stevedore, the porter?\n\nBroader and deeper we must write our annals,--from an ethical\nreformation, from an influx of the ever new, ever sanative\nconscience,--if we would trulier express our central and wide-related\nnature, instead of this old chronology of selfishness and pride to which\nwe have too long lent our eyes. Already that day exists for us, shines\nin on us at unawares, but the path of science and of letters is not\nthe way into nature. The idiot, the Indian, the child and unschooled\nfarmer's boy stand nearer to the light by which nature is to be read,\nthan the dissector or the antiquary.\n\n*****\n\n\n     SELF-RELIANCE.\n\n     \"Ne te quaesiveris extra.\"\n\n     \"Man is his own star; and the soul that can\n     Render an honest and a perfect man,\n     Commands all light, all influence, all fate;\n     Nothing to him falls early or too late.\n     Our acts our angels are, or good or ill,\n     Our fatal shadows that walk by us still.\"\n\n     Epilogue to Beaumont and Fletcher's Honest Man's Fortune.\n\n\n\n     Cast the bantling on the rocks,\n     Suckle him with the she-wolf's teat,\n     Wintered with the hawk and fox.\n     Power and speed be hands and feet.\n\n\n\n\nII. SELF-RELIANCE.\n\nI READ the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which\nwere original and not conventional. The soul always hears an admonition\nin such lines, let the subject be what it may. The sentiment they instil\nis of more value than any thought they may contain. To believe your own\nthought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is\ntrue for all men,--that is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and\nit shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the\noutmost, and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets\nof the Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the\nhighest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato and Milton is that they set\nat naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men, but what they\nthought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light\nwhich flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of\nthe firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his\nthought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our\nown rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated\nmajesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us\nthan this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with\ngood-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on\nthe other side. Else to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good\nsense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall\nbe forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.\n\nThere is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the\nconviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he\nmust take himself for better for worse as his portion; that though the\nwide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to\nhim but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given\nto him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and\nnone but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until\nhe has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes\nmuch impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory\nis not without preestablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray\nshould fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half\nexpress ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of\nus represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good\nissues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work\nmade manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put\nhis heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done\notherwise shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not\ndeliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no\ninvention, no hope.\n\nTrust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the\nplace the divine providence has found for you, the society of your\ncontemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so,\nand confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying\ntheir perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their\nheart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being.\nAnd we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same\ntranscendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner,\nnot cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers and\nbenefactors, obeying the Almighty effort and advancing on Chaos and the\nDark.\n\nWhat pretty oracles nature yields us on this text in the face and\nbehavior of children, babes, and even brutes! That divided and rebel\nmind, that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed\nthe strength and means opposed to our purpose, these have not. Their\nmind being whole, their eye is as yet unconquered, and when we look in\ntheir faces we are disconcerted. Infancy conforms to nobody; all conform\nto it; so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the adults\nwho prattle and play to it. So God has armed youth and puberty and\nmanhood no less with its own piquancy and charm, and made it enviable\nand gracious and its claims not to be put by, if it will stand by\nitself. Do not think the youth has no force, because he cannot speak to\nyou and me. Hark! in the next room his voice is sufficiently clear and\nemphatic. It seems he knows how to speak to his contemporaries. Bashful\nor bold then, he will know how to make us seniors very unnecessary.\n\nThe nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner, and would disdain\nas much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one, is the healthy\nattitude of human nature. A boy is in the parlor what the pit is in the\nplayhouse; independent, irresponsible, looking out from his corner on\nsuch people and facts as pass by, he tries and sentences them on their\nmerits, in the swift, summary way of boys, as good, bad, interesting,\nsilly, eloquent, troublesome. He cumbers himself never about\nconsequences, about interests; he gives an independent, genuine verdict.\nYou must court him; he does not court you. But the man is as it were\nclapped into jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has once acted or\nspoken with eclat he is a committed person, watched by the sympathy\nor the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now enter into his\naccount. There is no Lethe for this. Ah, that he could pass again into\nhis neutrality! Who can thus avoid all pledges and, having observed,\nobserve again from the same unaffected, unbiased, unbribable,\nunaffrighted innocence,--must always be formidable. He would utter\nopinions on all passing affairs, which being seen to be not private but\nnecessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men and put them in\nfear.\n\nThese are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint\nand inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in\nconspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a\njoint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing\nof his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture\nof the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance\nis its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and\ncustoms.\n\nWhoso would be a man, must be a nonconformist. He who would gather\nimmortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must\nexplore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity\nof your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the\nsuffrage of the world. I remember an answer which when quite young I was\nprompted to make to a valued adviser who was wont to importune me with\nthe dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, \"What have I to do\nwith the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within?\" my\nfriend suggested,--\"But these impulses may be from below, not from\nabove.\" I replied, \"They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the\nDevil's child, I will live then from the Devil.\" No law can be sacred\nto me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readily\ntransferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my\nconstitution; the only wrong what is against it. A man is to carry\nhimself in the presence of all opposition as if every thing were titular\nand ephemeral but he. I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to\nbadges and names, to large societies and dead institutions. Every decent\nand well-spoken individual affects and sways me more than is right. I\nought to go upright and vital, and speak the rude truth in all ways. If\nmalice and vanity wear the coat of philanthropy, shall that pass? If an\nangry bigot assumes this bountiful cause of Abolition, and comes to me\nwith his last news from Barbadoes, why should I not say to him, 'Go love\nthy infant; love thy wood-chopper; be good-natured and modest; have\nthat grace; and never varnish your hard, uncharitable ambition with this\nincredible tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off. Thy love afar\nis spite at home.' Rough and graceless would be such greeting, but truth\nis handsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness must have some\nedge to it,--else it is none. The doctrine of hatred must be preached,\nas the counteraction of the doctrine of love, when that pules and\nwhines. I shun father and mother and wife and brother when my genius\ncalls me. I would write on the lintels of the door-post, _Whim_. I hope\nit is somewhat better than whim at last, but we cannot spend the day\nin explanation. Expect me not to show cause why I seek or why I exclude\ncompany. Then again, do not tell me, as a good man did to-day, of my\nobligation to put all poor men in good situations. Are they my poor?\nI tell thee thou foolish philanthropist that I grudge the dollar, the\ndime, the cent, I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom\nI do not belong. There is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual\naffinity I am bought and sold; for them I will go to prison if need be;\nbut your miscellaneous popular charities; the education at college of\nfools; the building of meeting-houses to the vain end to which many now\nstand; alms to sots, and the thousand-fold Relief Societies;--though\nI confess with shame I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a\nwicked dollar which by and by I shall have the manhood to withhold.\n\nVirtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the\nrule. There is the man and his virtues. Men do what is called a good\naction, as some piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a\nfine in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade. Their works are\ndone as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world,--as\ninvalids and the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are penances. I\ndo not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is for itself and not for\na spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it\nbe genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady. I\nwish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding. I ask\nprimary evidence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal from the man\nto his actions. I know that for myself it makes no difference whether\nI do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent. I cannot\nconsent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right. Few and\nmean as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own\nassurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony.\n\nWhat I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This\nrule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for\nthe whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder\nbecause you will always find those who think they know what is your\nduty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the\nworld's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but\nthe great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect\nsweetness the independence of solitude.\n\nThe objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is\nthat it scatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the impression\nof your character. If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead\nBible-society, vote with a great party either for the government or\nagainst it, spread your table like base housekeepers,--under all these\nscreens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are: and of\ncourse so much force is withdrawn from your proper life. But do your\nwork, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reinforce\nyourself. A man must consider what a blindman's-buff is this game of\nconformity. If I know your sect, I anticipate your argument. I hear a\npreacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the\ninstitutions of his church. Do I not know beforehand that not possibly\ncan he say a new and spontaneous word? Do I not know that with all this\nostentation of examining the grounds of the institution he will do no\nsuch thing? Do I not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but\nat one side, the permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister?\nHe is a retained attorney, and these airs of the bench are the emptiest\naffectation. Well, most men have bound their eyes with one or another\nhandkerchief, and attached themselves to some one of these communities\nof opinion. This conformity makes them not false in a few particulars,\nauthors of a few lies, but false in all particulars. Their every truth\nis not quite true. Their two is not the real two, their four not the\nreal four; so that every word they say chagrins us and we know not where\nto begin to set them right. Meantime nature is not slow to equip us in\nthe prison-uniform of the party to which we adhere. We come to wear\none cut of face and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine\nexpression. There is a mortifying experience in particular, which\ndoes not fail to wreak itself also in the general history; I mean \"the\nfoolish face of praise,\" the forced smile which we put on in company\nwhere we do not feel at ease in answer to conversation which does not\ninterest us. The muscles, not spontaneously moved but moved by a low\nusurping wilfulness, grow tight about the outline of the face with the\nmost disagreeable sensation.\n\nFor nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure. And\ntherefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face. The by-standers\nlook askance on him in the public street or in the friend's parlor. If\nthis aversation had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own\nhe might well go home with a sad countenance; but the sour faces of the\nmultitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on\nand off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs. Yet is the discontent\nof the multitude more formidable than that of the senate and the\ncollege. It is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to brook\nthe rage of the cultivated classes. Their rage is decorous and prudent,\nfor they are timid, as being very vulnerable themselves. But when to\ntheir feminine rage the indignation of the people is added, when the\nignorant and the poor are aroused, when the unintelligent brute force\nthat lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and mow, it needs\nthe habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike as a trifle of\nno concernment.\n\nThe other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a\nreverence for our past act or word because the eyes of others have no\nother data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath\nto disappoint them.\n\nBut why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about\nthis corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated\nin this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself;\nwhat then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory\nalone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for\njudgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. In\nyour metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity, yet when the\ndevout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though\nthey should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your theory, as\nJoseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.\n\nA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little\nstatesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul\nhas simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow\non the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words and to-morrow speak\nwhat to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict\nevery thing you said to-day.--'Ah, so you shall be sure to be\nmisunderstood.'--Is it so bad then to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was\nmisunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus,\nand Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took\nflesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.\n\nI suppose no man can violate his nature. All the sallies of his will\nare rounded in by the law of his being, as the inequalities of Andes\nand Himmaleh are insignificant in the curve of the sphere. Nor does it\nmatter how you gauge and try him. A character is like an acrostic or\nAlexandrian stanza;--read it forward, backward, or across, it still\nspells the same thing. In this pleasing contrite wood-life which God\nallows me, let me record day by day my honest thought without prospect\nor retrospect, and, I cannot doubt, it will be found symmetrical, though\nI mean it not and see it not. My book should smell of pines and resound\nwith the hum of insects. The swallow over my window should interweave\nthat thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also. We pass\nfor what we are. Character teaches above our wills. Men imagine that\nthey communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not\nsee that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment.\n\nThere will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions, so they be\neach honest and natural in their hour. For of one will, the actions will\nbe harmonious, however unlike they seem. These varieties are lost sight\nof at a little distance, at a little height of thought. One tendency\nunites them all. The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of\na hundred tacks. See the line from a sufficient distance, and it\nstraightens itself to the average tendency. Your genuine action will\nexplain itself and will explain your other genuine actions. Your\nconformity explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have already done\nsingly will justify you now. Greatness appeals to the future. If I can\nbe firm enough to-day to do right and scorn eyes, I must have done so\nmuch right before as to defend me now. Be it how it will, do right now.\nAlways scorn appearances and you always may. The force of character is\ncumulative. All the foregone days of virtue work their health into this.\nWhat makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the field, which\nso fills the imagination? The consciousness of a train of great days and\nvictories behind. They shed an united light on the advancing actor. He\nis attended as by a visible escort of angels. That is it which throws\nthunder into Chatham's voice, and dignity into Washington's port, and\nAmerica into Adams's eye. Honor is venerable to us because it is no\nephemera. It is always ancient virtue. We worship it to-day because it\nis not of to-day. We love it and pay it homage because it is not a\ntrap for our love and homage, but is self-dependent, self-derived,\nand therefore of an old immaculate pedigree, even if shown in a young\nperson.\n\nI hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity and\nconsistency. Let the words be gazetted and ridiculous henceforward.\nInstead of the gong for dinner, let us hear a whistle from the Spartan\nfife. Let us never bow and apologize more. A great man is coming to eat\nat my house. I do not wish to please him; I wish that he should wish to\nplease me. I will stand here for humanity, and though I would make it\nkind, I would make it true. Let us affront and reprimand the smooth\nmediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl in the face\nof custom and trade and office, the fact which is the upshot of all\nhistory, that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working\nwherever a man works; that a true man belongs to no other time or place,\nbut is the centre of things. Where he is, there is nature. He measures\nyou and all men and all events. Ordinarily, every body in society\nreminds us of somewhat else, or of some other person. Character,\nreality, reminds you of nothing else; it takes place of the whole\ncreation. The man must be so much that he must make all circumstances\nindifferent. Every true man is a cause, a country, and an age;\nrequires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his\ndesign;--and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients. A\nman Caesar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is\nborn, and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius that he is\nconfounded with virtue and the possible of man. An institution is the\nlengthened shadow of one man; as, Monachism, of the Hermit Antony;\nthe Reformation, of Luther; Quakerism, of Fox; Methodism, of Wesley;\nAbolition, of Clarkson. Scipio, Milton called \"the height of Rome\";\nand all history Resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few\nstout and earnest persons.\n\nLet a man then know his worth, and keep things under his feet. Let him\nnot peep or steal, or skulk up and down with the air of a charity-boy, a\nbastard, or an interloper in the world which exists for him. But the\nman in the street, finding no worth in himself which corresponds to the\nforce which built a tower or sculptured a marble god, feels poor when\nhe looks on these. To him a palace, a statue, or a costly book have an\nalien and forbidding air, much like a gay equipage, and seem to say like\nthat, 'Who are you, Sir?' Yet they all are his, suitors for his\nnotice, petitioners to his faculties that they will come out and take\npossession. The picture waits for my verdict; it is not to command me,\nbut I am to settle its claims to praise. That popular fable of the sot\nwho was picked up dead drunk in the street, carried to the duke's house,\nwashed and dressed and laid in the duke's bed, and, on his waking,\ntreated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke, and assured that he\nhad been insane, owes its popularity to the fact that it symbolizes so\nwell the state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now and\nthen wakes up, exercises his reason and finds himself a true prince.\n\nOur reading is mendicant and sycophantic. In history our imagination\nplays us false. Kingdom and lordship, power and estate, are a gaudier\nvocabulary than private John and Edward in a small house and common\nday's work; but the things of life are the same to both; the sum total\nof both is the same. Why all this deference to Alfred and Scanderbeg and\nGustavus? Suppose they were virtuous; did they wear out virtue? As great\na stake depends on your private act to-day, as followed their public\nand renowned steps. When private men shall act with original views,\nthe lustre will be transferred from the actions of kings to those of\ngentlemen.\n\nThe world has been instructed by its kings, who have so magnetized the\neyes of nations. It has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual\nreverence that is due from man to man. The joyful loyalty with which men\nhave everywhere suffered the king, the noble, or the great proprietor\nto walk among them by a law of his own, make his own scale of men and\nthings and reverse theirs, pay for benefits not with money but with\nhonor, and represent the law in his person, was the hieroglyphic by\nwhich they obscurely signified their consciousness of their own right\nand comeliness, the right of every man.\n\nThe magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we\ninquire the reason of self-trust. Who is the Trustee? What is the\naboriginal Self, on which a universal reliance may be grounded? What is\nthe nature and power of that science-baffling star, without parallax,\nwithout calculable elements, which shoots a ray of beauty even into\ntrivial and impure actions, if the least mark of independence appear?\nThe inquiry leads us to that source, at once the essence of genius, of\nvirtue, and of life, which we call Spontaneity or Instinct. We denote\nthis primary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all later teachings are\ntuitions. In that deep force, the last fact behind which analysis cannot\ngo, all things find their common origin. For the sense of being which\nin calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse from\nthings, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them\nand proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and\nbeing also proceed. We first share the life by which things exist and\nafterwards see them as appearances in nature and forget that we have\nshared their cause. Here is the fountain of action and of thought. Here\nare the lungs of that inspiration which giveth man wisdom and which\ncannot be denied without impiety and atheism. We lie in the lap of\nimmense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organs\nof its activity. When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do\nnothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams. If we ask whence\nthis comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all philosophy\nis at fault. Its presence or its absence is all we can affirm. Every man\ndiscriminates between the voluntary acts of his mind and his involuntary\nperceptions, and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect\nfaith is due. He may err in the expression of them, but he knows that\nthese things are so, like day and night, not to be disputed. My wilful\nactions and acquisitions are but roving;--the idlest reverie, the\nfaintest native emotion, command my curiosity and respect. Thoughtless\npeople contradict as readily the statement of perceptions as of\nopinions, or rather much more readily; for they do not distinguish\nbetween perception and notion. They fancy that I choose to see this\nor that thing. But perception is not whimsical, but fatal. If I see\na trait, my children will see it after me, and in course of time all\nmankind,--although it may chance that no one has seen it before me. For\nmy perception of it is as much a fact as the sun.\n\nThe relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure that it is\nprofane to seek to interpose helps. It must be that when God speaketh he\nshould communicate, not one thing, but all things; should fill the world\nwith his voice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, souls, from\nthe centre of the present thought; and new date and new create the\nwhole. Whenever a mind is simple and receives a divine wisdom, old\nthings pass away,--means, teachers, texts, temples fall; it lives now,\nand absorbs past and future into the present hour. All things are\nmade sacred by relation to it,--one as much as another. All things are\ndissolved to their centre by their cause, and in the universal miracle\npetty and particular miracles disappear. If therefore a man claims to\nknow and speak of God and carries you backward to the phraseology of\nsome old mouldered nation in another country, in another world, believe\nhim not. Is the acorn better than the oak which is its fulness and\ncompletion? Is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast\nhis ripened being? Whence then this worship of the past? The centuries\nare conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul. Time and\nspace are but physiological colors which the eye makes, but the soul is\nlight: where it is, is day; where it was, is night; and history is\nan impertinence and an injury if it be any thing more than a cheerful\napologue or parable of my being and becoming.\n\nMan is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say\n'I think,' 'I am,' but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before\nthe blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make\nno reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they\nare; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is\nsimply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before\na leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower\nthere is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature\nis satisfied and it satisfies nature in all moments alike. But man\npostpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with\nreverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround\nhim, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and\nstrong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.\n\nThis should be plain enough. Yet see what strong intellects dare not\nyet hear God himself unless he speak the phraseology of I know not what\nDavid, or Jeremiah, or Paul. We shall not always set so great a price on\na few texts, on a few lives. We are like children who repeat by rote the\nsentences of grandames and tutors, and, as they grow older, of the men\nof talents and character they chance to see,--painfully recollecting\nthe exact words they spoke; afterwards, when they come into the point of\nview which those had who uttered these sayings, they understand them and\nare willing to let the words go; for at any time they can use words as\ngood when occasion comes. If we live truly, we shall see truly. It is as\neasy for the strong man to be strong, as it is for the weak to be weak.\nWhen we have new perception, we shall gladly disburden the memory of its\nhoarded treasures as old rubbish. When a man lives with God, his voice\nshall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of the corn.\n\nAnd now at last the highest truth on this subject remains unsaid;\nprobably cannot be said; for all that we say is the far-off remembering\nof the intuition. That thought by what I can now nearest approach to say\nit, is this. When good is near you, when you have life in yourself,\nit is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the\nfootprints of any other; you shall not see the face of man; you shall\nnot hear any name;--the way, the thought, the good shall be wholly\nstrange and new. It shall exclude example and experience. You take\nthe way from man, not to man. All persons that ever existed are its\nforgotten ministers. Fear and hope are alike beneath it. There is\nsomewhat low even in hope. In the hour of vision there is nothing that\ncan be called gratitude, nor properly joy. The soul raised over passion\nbeholds identity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existence of\nTruth and Right, and calms itself with knowing that all things go well.\nVast spaces of nature, the Atlantic Ocean, the South Sea; long intervals\nof time, years, centuries, are of no account. This which I think and\nfeel underlay every former state of life and circumstances, as it does\nunderlie my present, and what is called life, and what is called death.\n\nLife only avails, not the having lived. Power ceases in the instant\nof repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new\nstate, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim. This one\nfact the world hates; that the soul becomes; for that for ever degrades\nthe past, turns all riches to poverty, all reputation to a shame,\nconfounds the saint with the rogue, shoves Jesus and Judas equally\naside. Why then do we prate of self-reliance? Inasmuch as the soul is\npresent there will be power not confident but agent. To talk of reliance\nis a poor external way of speaking. Speak rather of that which relies\nbecause it works and is. Who has more obedience than I masters me,\nthough he should not raise his finger. Round him I must revolve by the\ngravitation of spirits. We fancy it rhetoric when we speak of eminent\nvirtue. We do not yet see that virtue is Height, and that a man or\na company of men, plastic and permeable to principles, by the law of\nnature must overpower and ride all cities, nations, kings, rich men,\npoets, who are not.\n\nThis is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach on this, as on every\ntopic, the resolution of all into the ever-blessed ONE. Self-existence\nis the attribute of the Supreme Cause, and it constitutes the measure of\ngood by the degree in which it enters into all lower forms. All things\nreal are so by so much virtue as they contain. Commerce, husbandry,\nhunting, whaling, war, eloquence, personal weight, are somewhat, and\nengage my respect as examples of its presence and impure action. I see\nthe same law working in nature for conservation and growth. Power is, in\nnature, the essential measure of right. Nature suffers nothing to remain\nin her kingdoms which cannot help itself. The genesis and maturation of\na planet, its poise and orbit, the bended tree recovering itself from\nthe strong wind, the vital resources of every animal and vegetable, are\ndemonstrations of the self-sufficing and therefore self-relying soul.\n\nThus all concentrates: let us not rove; let us sit at home with the\ncause. Let us stun and astonish the intruding rabble of men and books\nand institutions, by a simple declaration of the divine fact. Bid the\ninvaders take the shoes from off their feet, for God is here within. Let\nour simplicity judge them, and our docility to our own law demonstrate\nthe poverty of nature and fortune beside our native riches.\n\nBut now we are a mob. Man does not stand in awe of man, nor is his\ngenius admonished to stay at home, to put itself in communication with\nthe internal ocean, but it goes abroad to beg a cup of water of the\nurns of other men. We must go alone. I like the silent church before the\nservice begins, better than any preaching. How far off, how cool, how\nchaste the persons look, begirt each one with a precinct or sanctuary!\nSo let us always sit. Why should we assume the faults of our friend, or\nwife, or father, or child, because they sit around our hearth, or are\nsaid to have the same blood? All men have my blood and I have all men's.\nNot for that will I adopt their petulance or folly, even to the extent\nof being ashamed of it. But your isolation must not be mechanical, but\nspiritual, that is, must be elevation. At times the whole world seems to\nbe in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic trifles. Friend, client,\nchild, sickness, fear, want, charity, all knock at once at thy closet\ndoor and say,--'Come out unto us.' But keep thy state; come not into\ntheir confusion. The power men possess to annoy me I give them by a weak\ncuriosity. No man can come near me but through my act. \"What we love\nthat we have, but by desire we bereave ourselves of the love.\"\n\nIf we cannot at once rise to the sanctities of obedience and faith, let\nus at least resist our temptations; let us enter into the state of war\nand wake Thor and Woden, courage and constancy, in our Saxon breasts.\nThis is to be done in our smooth times by speaking the truth. Check this\nlying hospitality and lying affection. Live no longer to the expectation\nof these deceived and deceiving people with whom we converse. Say to\nthem, 'O father, O mother, O wife, O brother, O friend, I have lived\nwith you after appearances hitherto. Henceforward I am the truth's. Be\nit known unto you that henceforward I obey no law less than the eternal\nlaw. I will have no covenants but proximities. I shall endeavour to\nnourish my parents, to support my family, to be the chaste husband of\none wife,--but these relations I must fill after a new and unprecedented\nway. I appeal from your customs. I must be myself. I cannot break myself\nany longer for you, or you. If you can love me for what I am, we shall\nbe the happier. If you cannot, I will still seek to deserve that you\nshould. I will not hide my tastes or aversions. I will so trust that\nwhat is deep is holy, that I will do strongly before the sun and moon\nwhatever inly rejoices me and the heart appoints. If you are noble,\nI will love you: if you are not, I will not hurt you and myself by\nhypocritical attentions. If you are true, but not in the same truth\nwith me, cleave to your companions; I will seek my own. I do this not\nselfishly but humbly and truly. It is alike your interest, and mine, and\nall men's, however long we have dwelt in lies, to live in truth. Does\nthis sound harsh to-day? You will soon love what is dictated by your\nnature as well as mine, and if we follow the truth it will bring us\nout safe at last.'--But so may you give these friends pain. Yes, but I\ncannot sell my liberty and my power, to save their sensibility. Besides,\nall persons have their moments of reason, when they look out into the\nregion of absolute truth; then will they justify me and do the same\nthing.\n\nThe populace think that your rejection of popular standards is a\nrejection of all standard, and mere antinomianism; and the bold\nsensualist will use the name of philosophy to gild his crimes. But the\nlaw of consciousness abides. There are two confessionals, in one or the\nother of which we must be shriven. You may fulfil your round of duties\nby clearing yourself in the direct, or in the reflex way. Consider\nwhether you have satisfied your relations to father, mother, cousin,\nneighbor, town, cat, and dog; whether any of these can upbraid you. But\nI may also neglect this reflex standard and absolve me to myself. I have\nmy own stern claims and perfect circle. It denies the name of duty to\nmany offices that are called duties. But if I can discharge its debts it\nenables me to dispense with the popular code. If any one imagines that\nthis law is lax, let him keep its commandment one day.\n\nAnd truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the\ncommon motives of humanity and has ventured to trust himself for a\ntaskmaster. High be his heart, faithful his will, clear his sight, that\nhe may in good earnest be doctrine, society, law, to himself, that a\nsimple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to others!\n\nIf any man consider the present aspects of what is called by distinction\nsociety, he will see the need of these ethics. The sinew and heart\nof man seem to be drawn out, and we are become timorous, desponding\nwhimperers. We are afraid of truth, afraid of fortune, afraid of death\nand afraid of each other. Our age yields no great and perfect persons.\nWe want men and women who shall renovate life and our social state, but\nwe see that most natures are insolvent, cannot satisfy their own wants,\nhave an ambition out of all proportion to their practical force and do\nlean and beg day and night continually. Our housekeeping is mendicant,\nour arts, our occupations, our marriages, our religion we have not\nchosen, but society has chosen for us. We are parlor soldiers. We shun\nthe rugged battle of fate, where strength is born.\n\nIf our young men miscarry in their first enterprises they lose all\nheart. If the young merchant fails, men say he is ruined. If the finest\ngenius studies at one of our colleges and is not installed in an office\nwithin one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New\nYork, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being\ndisheartened and in complaining the rest of his life. A sturdy lad from\nNew Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions,\nwho teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits\na newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in\nsuccessive years, and always like a cat falls on his feet, is worth a\nhundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days and feels no\nshame in not 'studying a profession,' for he does not postpone his life,\nbut lives already. He has not one chance, but a hundred chances. Let\na Stoic open the resources of man and tell men they are not leaning\nwillows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of\nself-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh,\nborn to shed healing to the nations; that he should be ashamed of our\ncompassion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws,\nthe books, idolatries and customs out of the window, we pity him no more\nbut thank and revere him;--and that teacher shall restore the life of\nman to splendor and make his name dear to all history.\n\nIt is easy to see that a greater self-reliance must work a revolution\nin all the offices and relations of men; in their religion; in their\neducation; in their pursuits; their modes of living; their association;\nin their property; in their speculative views.\n\n1. In what prayers do men allow themselves! That which they call a holy\noffice is not so much as brave and manly. Prayer looks abroad and asks\nfor some foreign addition to come through some foreign virtue, and loses\nitself in endless mazes of natural and supernatural, and mediatorial and\nmiraculous. Prayer that craves a particular commodity, any thing less\nthan all good, is vicious. Prayer is the contemplation of the facts of\nlife from the highest point of view. It is the soliloquy of a beholding\nand jubilant soul. It is the spirit of God pronouncing his works good.\nBut prayer as a means to effect a private end is meanness and theft. It\nsupposes dualism and not unity in nature and consciousness. As soon as\nthe man is at one with God, he will not beg. He will then see prayer in\nall action. The prayer of the farmer kneeling in his field to weed it,\nthe prayer of the rower kneeling with the stroke of his oar, are true\nprayers heard throughout nature, though for cheap ends. Caratach, in\nFletcher's Bonduca, when admonished to inquire the mind of the god\nAudate, replies,--\n\n \"His hidden meaning lies in our endeavors;\n  Our valors are our best gods.\"\n\nAnother sort of false prayers are our regrets. Discontent is the want\nof self-reliance: it is infirmity of will. Regret calamities if you can\nthereby help the sufferer; if not, attend your own work and already the\nevil begins to be repaired. Our sympathy is just as base. We come to\nthem who weep foolishly and sit down and cry for company, instead of\nimparting to them truth and health in rough electric shocks, putting\nthem once more in communication with their own reason. The secret of\nfortune is joy in our hands. Welcome evermore to gods and men is the\nself-helping man. For him all doors are flung wide; him all tongues\ngreet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire. Our love goes out\nto him and embraces him because he did not need it. We solicitously and\napologetically caress and celebrate him because he held on his way and\nscorned our disapprobation. The gods love him because men hated him.\n\"To the persevering mortal,\" said Zoroaster, \"the blessed Immortals are\nswift.\"\n\nAs men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a\ndisease of the intellect. They say with those foolish Israelites, 'Let\nnot God speak to us, lest we die. Speak thou, speak any man with us, and\nwe will obey.' Everywhere I am hindered of meeting God in my brother,\nbecause he has shut his own temple doors and recites fables merely of\nhis brother's, or his brother's brother's God. Every new mind is a new\nclassification. If it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power,\na Locke, a Lavoisier, a Hutton, a Bentham, a Fourier, it imposes its\nclassification on other men, and lo! a new system. In proportion to the\ndepth of the thought, and so to the number of the objects it touches\nand brings within reach of the pupil, is his complacency. But chiefly is\nthis apparent in creeds and churches, which are also classifications of\nsome powerful mind acting on the elemental thought of duty, and man's\nrelation to the Highest. Such is Calvinism, Quakerism, Swedenborgism.\nThe pupil takes the same delight in subordinating every thing to the new\nterminology as a girl who has just learned botany in seeing a new earth\nand new seasons thereby. It will happen for a time that the pupil will\nfind his intellectual power has grown by the study of his master's mind.\nBut in all unbalanced minds the classification is idolized, passes for\nthe end and not for a speedily exhaustible means, so that the walls of\nthe system blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the walls of\nthe universe; the luminaries of heaven seem to them hung on the arch\ntheir master built. They cannot imagine how you aliens have any right to\nsee,--how you can see; 'It must be somehow that you stole the light from\nus.' They do not yet perceive that light, unsystematic, indomitable,\nwill break into any cabin, even into theirs. Let them chirp awhile and\ncall it their own. If they are honest and do well, presently their neat\nnew pinfold will be too strait and low, will crack, will lean, will rot\nand vanish, and the immortal light, all young and joyful, million-orbed,\nmillion-colored, will beam over the universe as on the first morning.\n\n2. It is for want of self-culture that the superstition of Travelling,\nwhose idols are Italy, England, Egypt, retains its fascination for all\neducated Americans. They who made England, Italy, or Greece venerable in\nthe imagination did so by sticking fast where they were, like an axis of\nthe earth. In manly hours we feel that duty is our place. The soul is\nno traveller; the wise man stays at home, and when his necessities, his\nduties, on any occasion call him from his house, or into foreign lands,\nhe is at home still and shall make men sensible by the expression of\nhis countenance that he goes, the missionary of wisdom and virtue, and\nvisits cities and men like a sovereign and not like an interloper or a\nvalet.\n\nI have no churlish objection to the circumnavigation of the globe for\nthe purposes of art, of study, and benevolence, so that the man is first\ndomesticated, or does not go abroad with the hope of finding somewhat\ngreater than he knows. He who travels to be amused, or to get somewhat\nwhich he does not carry, travels away from himself, and grows old even\nin youth among old things. In Thebes, in Palmyra, his will and mind have\nbecome old and dilapidated as they. He carries ruins to ruins.\n\nTravelling is a fool's paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the\nindifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can\nbe intoxicated with beauty and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace\nmy friends, embark on the sea and at last wake up in Naples, and there\nbeside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical,\nthat I fled from. I seek the Vatican and the palaces. I affect to be\nintoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated. My\ngiant goes with me wherever I go.\n\n3. But the rage of travelling is a symptom of a deeper unsoundness\naffecting the whole intellectual action. The intellect is vagabond, and\nour system of education fosters restlessness. Our minds travel when our\nbodies are forced to stay at home. We imitate; and what is imitation but\nthe travelling of the mind? Our houses are built with foreign taste; our\nshelves are garnished with foreign ornaments; our opinions, our tastes,\nour faculties, lean, and follow the Past and the Distant. The soul\ncreated the arts wherever they have flourished. It was in his own mind\nthat the artist sought his model. It was an application of his own\nthought to the thing to be done and the conditions to be observed. And\nwhy need we copy the Doric or the Gothic model? Beauty, convenience,\ngrandeur of thought and quaint expression are as near to us as to any,\nand if the American artist will study with hope and love the precise\nthing to be done by him, considering the climate, the soil, the\nlength of the day, the wants of the people, the habit and form of\nthe government, he will create a house in which all these will find\nthemselves fitted, and taste and sentiment will be satisfied also.\n\nInsist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can present every\nmoment with the cumulative force of a whole life's cultivation; but\nof the adopted talent of another you have only an extemporaneous half\npossession. That which each can do best, none but his Maker can\nteach him. No man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has\nexhibited it. Where is the master who could have taught Shakspeare?\nWhere is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington,\nor Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is a unique. The Scipionism of\nScipio is precisely that part he could not borrow. Shakspeare will never\nbe made by the study of Shakspeare. Do that which is assigned you, and\nyou cannot hope too much or dare too much. There is at this moment\nfor you an utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal chisel of\nPhidias, or trowel of the Egyptians, or the pen of Moses or Dante, but\ndifferent from all these. Not possibly will the soul, all rich, all\neloquent, with thousand-cloven tongue, deign to repeat itself; but if\nyou can hear what these patriarchs say, surely you can reply to them in\nthe same pitch of voice; for the ear and the tongue are two organs of\none nature. Abide in the simple and noble regions of thy life, obey thy\nheart and thou shalt reproduce the Foreworld again.\n\n4. As our Religion, our Education, our Art look abroad, so does our\nspirit of society. All men plume themselves on the improvement of\nsociety, and no man improves.\n\nSociety never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as it gains\non the other. It undergoes continual changes; it is barbarous, it is\ncivilized, it is christianized, it is rich, it is scientific; but this\nchange is not amelioration. For every thing that is given something\nis taken. Society acquires new arts and loses old instincts. What a\ncontrast between the well-clad, reading, writing, thinking American,\nwith a watch, a pencil and a bill of exchange in his pocket, and the\nnaked New Zealander, whose property is a club, a spear, a mat and an\nundivided twentieth of a shed to sleep under! But compare the health of\nthe two men and you shall see that the white man has lost his aboriginal\nstrength. If the traveller tell us truly, strike the savage with a broad\naxe and in a day or two the flesh shall unite and heal as if you struck\nthe blow into soft pitch, and the same blow shall send the white to his\ngrave.\n\nThe civilized man has built a coach, but has lost the use of his feet.\nHe is supported on crutches, but lacks so much support of muscle. He has\na fine Geneva watch, but he fails of the skill to tell the hour by\nthe sun. A Greenwich nautical almanac he has, and so being sure of the\ninformation when he wants it, the man in the street does not know a star\nin the sky. The solstice he does not observe; the equinox he knows as\nlittle; and the whole bright calendar of the year is without a dial in\nhis mind. His note-books impair his memory; his libraries overload his\nwit; the insurance-office increases the number of accidents; and it may\nbe a question whether machinery does not encumber; whether we have\nnot lost by refinement some energy, by a Christianity entrenched in\nestablishments and forms some vigor of wild virtue. For every Stoic was\na Stoic; but in Christendom where is the Christian?\n\nThere is no more deviation in the moral standard than in the standard\nof height or bulk. No greater men are now than ever were. A singular\nequality may be observed between the great men of the first and of the\nlast ages; nor can all the science, art, religion, and philosophy of the\nnineteenth century avail to educate greater men than Plutarch's\nheroes, three or four and twenty centuries ago. Not in time is the race\nprogressive. Phocion, Socrates, Anaxagoras, Diogenes, are great men, but\nthey leave no class. He who is really of their class will not be called\nby their name, but will be his own man, and in his turn the founder of a\nsect. The arts and inventions of each period are only its costume and\ndo not invigorate men. The harm of the improved machinery may compensate\nits good. Hudson and Behring accomplished so much in their fishing-boats\nas to astonish Parry and Franklin, whose equipment exhausted the\nresources of science and art. Galileo, with an opera-glass, discovered a\nmore splendid series of celestial phenomena than any one since. Columbus\nfound the New World in an undecked boat. It is curious to see the\nperiodical disuse and perishing of means and machinery which were\nintroduced with loud laudation a few years or centuries before. The\ngreat genius returns to essential man. We reckoned the improvements of\nthe art of war among the triumphs of science, and yet Napoleon conquered\nEurope by the bivouac, which consisted of falling back on naked valor\nand disencumbering it of all aids. The Emperor held it impossible to\nmake a perfect army, says Las Cases, \"without abolishing our arms,\nmagazines, commissaries and carriages, until, in imitation of the Roman\ncustom, the soldier should receive his supply of corn, grind it in his\nhand-mill, and bake his bread himself.\"\n\nSociety is a wave. The wave moves onward, but the water of which it is\ncomposed does not. The same particle does not rise from the valley\nto the ridge. Its unity is only phenomenal. The persons who make up a\nnation to-day, next year die, and their experience with them.\n\nAnd so the reliance on Property, including the reliance on governments\nwhich protect it, is the want of self-reliance. Men have looked away\nfrom themselves and at things so long that they have come to esteem the\nreligious, learned and civil institutions as guards of property, and\nthey deprecate assaults on these, because they feel them to be assaults\non property. They measure their esteem of each other by what each has,\nand not by what each is. But a cultivated man becomes ashamed of his\nproperty, out of new respect for his nature. Especially he hates what\nhe has if he see that it is accidental,--came to him by inheritance, or\ngift, or crime; then he feels that it is not having; it does not belong\nto him, has no root in him and merely lies there because no revolution\nor no robber takes it away. But that which a man is, does always by\nnecessity acquire, and what the man acquires is living property, which\ndoes not wait the beck of rulers, or mobs, or revolutions, or fire, or\nstorm, or bankruptcies, but perpetually renews itself wherever the man\nbreathes. \"Thy lot or portion of life,\" said the Caliph Ali, \"is seeking\nafter thee; therefore be at rest from seeking after it.\" Our dependence\non these foreign goods leads us to our slavish respect for numbers.\nThe political parties meet in numerous conventions; the greater the\nconcourse and with each new uproar of announcement, The delegation from\nEssex! The Democrats from New Hampshire! The Whigs of Maine! the young\npatriot feels himself stronger than before by a new thousand of eyes\nand arms. In like manner the reformers summon conventions and vote and\nresolve in multitude. Not so, O friends! will the God deign to enter and\ninhabit you, but by a method precisely the reverse. It is only as a\nman puts off all foreign support and stands alone that I see him to be\nstrong and to prevail. He is weaker by every recruit to his banner. Is\nnot a man better than a town? Ask nothing of men, and, in the endless\nmutation, thou only firm column must presently appear the upholder of\nall that surrounds thee. He who knows that power is inborn, that he is\nweak because he has looked for good out of him and elsewhere, and so\nperceiving, throws himself unhesitatingly on his thought, instantly\nrights himself, stands in the erect position, commands his limbs, works\nmiracles; just as a man who stands on his feet is stronger than a man\nwho stands on his head.\n\nSo use all that is called Fortune. Most men gamble with her, and gain\nall, and lose all, as her wheel rolls. But do thou leave as unlawful\nthese winnings, and deal with Cause and Effect, the chancellors of God.\nIn the Will work and acquire, and thou hast chained the wheel of Chance,\nand shalt sit hereafter out of fear from her rotations. A political\nvictory, a rise of rents, the recovery of your sick or the return of\nyour absent friend, or some other favorable event raises your spirits,\nand you think good days are preparing for you. Do not believe it.\nNothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace\nbut the triumph of principles.\n\n*****\n\n\n     COMPENSATION.\n\n     The wings of Time are black and white,\n     Pied with morning and with night.\n     Mountain tall and ocean deep\n     Trembling balance duly keep.\n     In changing moon, in tidal wave,\n     Glows the feud of Want and Have.\n     Gauge of more and less through space\n     Electric star and pencil plays.\n     The lonely Earth amid the balls\n     That hurry through the eternal halls,\n     A makeweight flying to the void,\n     Supplemental asteroid,\n     Or compensatory spark,\n     Shoots across the neutral Dark.\n\n     Man's the elm, and Wealth the vine,\n     Stanch and strong the tendrils twine:\n     Though the frail ringlets thee deceive,\n     None from its stock that vine can reave.\n     Fear not, then, thou child infirm,\n     There's no god dare wrong a worm.\n     Laurel crowns cleave to deserts\n     And power to him who power exerts;\n     Hast not thy share? On winged feet,\n     Lo! it rushes thee to meet;\n     And all that Nature made thy own,\n     Floating in air or pent in stone,\n     Will rive the hills and swim the sea\n     And, like thy shadow, follow thee.\n\n\n\n\nIII. COMPENSATION.\n\nEver since I was a boy I have wished to write a discourse on\nCompensation; for it seemed to me when very young that on this subject\nlife was ahead of theology and the people knew more than the preachers\ntaught. The documents too from which the doctrine is to be drawn,\ncharmed my fancy by their endless variety, and lay always before me,\neven in sleep; for they are the tools in our hands, the bread in our\nbasket, the transactions of the street, the farm and the dwelling-house;\ngreetings, relations, debts and credits, the influence of character, the\nnature and endowment of all men. It seemed to me also that in it might\nbe shown men a ray of divinity, the present action of the soul of this\nworld, clean from all vestige of tradition; and so the heart of man\nmight be bathed by an inundation of eternal love, conversing with that\nwhich he knows was always and always must be, because it really is now.\nIt appeared moreover that if this doctrine could be stated in terms\nwith any resemblance to those bright intuitions in which this truth\nis sometimes revealed to us, it would be a star in many dark hours and\ncrooked passages in our journey, that would not suffer us to lose our\nway.\n\nI was lately confirmed in these desires by hearing a sermon at church.\nThe preacher, a man esteemed for his orthodoxy, unfolded in the ordinary\nmanner the doctrine of the Last Judgment. He assumed that judgment is\nnot executed in this world; that the wicked are successful; that the\ngood are miserable; and then urged from reason and from Scripture a\ncompensation to be made to both parties in the next life. No offence\nappeared to be taken by the congregation at this doctrine. As far as I\ncould observe when the meeting broke up they separated without remark on\nthe sermon.\n\nYet what was the import of this teaching? What did the preacher mean\nby saying that the good are miserable in the present life? Was it that\nhouses and lands, offices, wine, horses, dress, luxury, are had by\nunprincipled men, whilst the saints are poor and despised; and that a\ncompensation is to be made to these last hereafter, by giving them the\nlike gratifications another day,--bank-stock and doubloons, venison and\nchampagne? This must be the compensation intended; for what else? Is it\nthat they are to have leave to pray and praise? to love and serve men?\nWhy, that they can do now. The legitimate inference the disciple\nwould draw was,--'We are to have such a good time as the sinners have\nnow';--or, to push it to its extreme import,--'You sin now; we shall\nsin by and by; we would sin now, if we could; not being successful, we\nexpect our revenge to-morrow.'\n\nThe fallacy lay in the immense concession that the bad are successful;\nthat justice is not done now. The blindness of the preacher consisted in\ndeferring to the base estimate of the market of what constitutes a manly\nsuccess, instead of confronting and convicting the world from the truth;\nannouncing the presence of the soul; the omnipotence of the will; and so\nestablishing the standard of good and ill, of success and falsehood.\n\nI find a similar base tone in the popular religious works of the day and\nthe same doctrines assumed by the literary men when occasionally they\ntreat the related topics. I think that our popular theology has\ngained in decorum, and not in principle, over the superstitions it has\ndisplaced. But men are better than their theology. Their daily life\ngives it the lie. Every ingenuous and aspiring soul leaves the doctrine\nbehind him in his own experience, and all men feel sometimes the\nfalsehood which they cannot demonstrate. For men are wiser than they\nknow. That which they hear in schools and pulpits without afterthought,\nif said in conversation would probably be questioned in silence. If a\nman dogmatize in a mixed company on Providence and the divine laws, he\nis answered by a silence which conveys well enough to an observer\nthe dissatisfaction of the hearer, but his incapacity to make his own\nstatement.\n\nI shall attempt in this and the following chapter to record some facts\nthat indicate the path of the law of Compensation; happy beyond my\nexpectation if I shall truly draw the smallest arc of this circle.\n\nPOLARITY, or action and reaction, we meet in every part of nature; in\ndarkness and light; in heat and cold; in the ebb and flow of waters;\nin male and female; in the inspiration and expiration of plants and\nanimals; in the equation of quantity and quality in the fluids of\nthe animal body; in the systole and diastole of the heart; in the\nundulations of fluids, and of sound; in the centrifugal and centripetal\ngravity; in electricity, galvanism, and chemical affinity. Superinduce\nmagnetism at one end of a needle, the opposite magnetism takes place at\nthe other end. If the south attracts, the north repels. To empty here,\nyou must condense there. An inevitable dualism bisects nature, so that\neach thing is a half, and suggests another thing to make it whole; as,\nspirit, matter; man, woman; odd, even; subjective, objective; in, out;\nupper, under; motion, rest; yea, nay.\n\nWhilst the world is thus dual, so is every one of its parts. The entire\nsystem of things gets represented in every particle. There is somewhat\nthat resembles the ebb and flow of the sea, day and night, man and\nwoman, in a single needle of the pine, in a kernel of corn, in each\nindividual of every animal tribe. The reaction, so grand in the\nelements, is repeated within these small boundaries. For example, in\nthe animal kingdom the physiologist has observed that no creatures are\nfavorites, but a certain compensation balances every gift and every\ndefect. A surplusage given to one part is paid out of a reduction from\nanother part of the same creature. If the head and neck are enlarged,\nthe trunk and extremities are cut short.\n\nThe theory of the mechanic forces is another example. What we gain in\npower is lost in time, and the converse. The periodic or compensating\nerrors of the planets is another instance. The influences of climate and\nsoil in political history are another. The cold climate invigorates. The\nbarren soil does not breed fevers, crocodiles, tigers or scorpions.\n\nThe same dualism underlies the nature and condition of man. Every excess\ncauses a defect; every defect an excess. Every sweet hath its sour;\nevery evil its good. Every faculty which is a receiver of pleasure has\nan equal penalty put on its abuse. It is to answer for its moderation\nwith its life. For every grain of wit there is a grain of folly. For\nevery thing you have missed, you have gained something else; and for\nevery thing you gain, you lose something. If riches increase, they are\nincreased that use them. If the gatherer gathers too much, Nature takes\nout of the man what she puts into his chest; swells the estate, but\nkills the owner. Nature hates monopolies and exceptions. The waves of\nthe sea do not more speedily seek a level from their loftiest tossing\nthan the varieties of condition tend to equalize themselves. There is\nalways some levelling circumstance that puts down the overbearing, the\nstrong, the rich, the fortunate, substantially on the same ground with\nall others. Is a man too strong and fierce for society and by temper and\nposition a bad citizen,--a morose ruffian, with a dash of the pirate\nin him?--Nature sends him a troop of pretty sons and daughters who are\ngetting along in the dame's classes at the village school, and love and\nfear for them smooths his grim scowl to courtesy. Thus she contrives to\nintenerate the granite and felspar, takes the boar out and puts the lamb\nin and keeps her balance true.\n\nThe farmer imagines power and place are fine things. But the President\nhas paid dear for his White House. It has commonly cost him all his\npeace, and the best of his manly attributes. To preserve for a short\ntime so conspicuous an appearance before the world, he is content to eat\ndust before the real masters who stand erect behind the throne. Or,\ndo men desire the more substantial and permanent grandeur of genius?\nNeither has this an immunity. He who by force of will or of thought is\ngreat and overlooks thousands, has the charges of that eminence. With\nevery influx of light comes new danger. Has he light? he must bear\nwitness to the light, and always outrun that sympathy which gives\nhim such keen satisfaction, by his fidelity to new revelations of the\nincessant soul. He must hate father and mother, wife and child. Has he\nall that the world loves and admires and covets?--he must cast behind\nhim their admiration, and afflict them by faithfulness to his truth, and\nbecome a byword and a hissing.\n\nThis law writes the laws of cities and nations. It is in vain to build\nor plot or combine against it. Things refuse to be mismanaged long. Res\nnolunt diu male administrari. Though no checks to a new evil appear,\nthe checks exist, and will appear. If the government is cruel, the\ngovernor's life is not safe. If you tax too high, the revenue will\nyield nothing. If you make the criminal code sanguinary, juries will\nnot convict. If the law is too mild, private vengeance comes in. If\nthe government is a terrific democracy, the pressure is resisted by\nan over-charge of energy in the citizen, and life glows with a fiercer\nflame. The true life and satisfactions of man seem to elude the utmost\nrigors or felicities of condition and to establish themselves with great\nindifferency under all varieties of circumstances. Under all governments\nthe influence of character remains the same,--in Turkey and in New\nEngland about alike. Under the primeval despots of Egypt, history\nhonestly confesses that man must have been as free as culture could make\nhim.\n\nThese appearances indicate the fact that the universe is represented\nin every one of its particles. Every thing in nature contains all\nthe powers of nature. Every thing is made of one hidden stuff; as the\nnaturalist sees one type under every metamorphosis, and regards a horse\nas a running man, a fish as a swimming man, a bird as a flying man, a\ntree as a rooted man. Each new form repeats not only the main\ncharacter of the type, but part for part all the details, all the aims,\nfurtherances, hindrances, energies and whole system of every other.\nEvery occupation, trade, art, transaction, is a compend of the world\nand a correlative of every other. Each one is an entire emblem of human\nlife; of its good and ill, its trials, its enemies, its course and its\nend. And each one must somehow accommodate the whole man and recite all\nhis destiny.\n\nThe world globes itself in a drop of dew. The microscope cannot find the\nanimalcule which is less perfect for being little. Eyes, ears, taste,\nsmell, motion, resistance, appetite, and organs of reproduction that\ntake hold on eternity,--all find room to consist in the small creature.\nSo do we put our life into every act. The true doctrine of omnipresence\nis that God reappears with all his parts in every moss and cobweb. The\nvalue of the universe contrives to throw itself into every point. If the\ngood is there, so is the evil; if the affinity, so the repulsion; if the\nforce, so the limitation.\n\nThus is the universe alive. All things are moral. That soul which within\nus is a sentiment, outside of us is a law. We feel its inspiration; out\nthere in history we can see its fatal strength. \"It is in the world, and\nthe world was made by it.\" Justice is not postponed. A perfect\nequity adjusts its balance in all parts of life. Hoi kuboi Dios aei\neupiptousi,--The dice of God are always loaded. The world looks like a\nmultiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you\nwill, balances itself. Take what figure you will, its exact value, nor\nmore nor less, still returns to you. Every secret is told, every crime\nis punished, every virtue rewarded, every wrong redressed, in silence\nand certainty. What we call retribution is the universal necessity by\nwhich the whole appears wherever a part appears. If you see smoke, there\nmust be fire. If you see a hand or a limb, you know that the trunk to\nwhich it belongs is there behind.\n\nEvery act rewards itself, or, in other words integrates itself, in a\ntwofold manner; first in the thing, or in real nature; and secondly in\nthe circumstance, or in apparent nature. Men call the circumstance the\nretribution. The causal retribution is in the thing and is seen by the\nsoul. The retribution in the circumstance is seen by the understanding;\nit is inseparable from the thing, but is often spread over a long time\nand so does not become distinct until after many years. The specific\nstripes may follow late after the offence, but they follow because they\naccompany it. Crime and punishment grow out of one stem. Punishment is\na fruit that unsuspected ripens within the flower of the pleasure which\nconcealed it. Cause and effect, means and ends, seed and fruit,\ncannot be severed; for the effect already blooms in the cause, the end\npreexists in the means, the fruit in the seed.\n\nWhilst thus the world will be whole and refuses to be disparted, we seek\nto act partially, to sunder, to appropriate; for example,--to gratify\nthe senses we sever the pleasure of the senses from the needs of\nthe character. The ingenuity of man has always been dedicated to the\nsolution of one problem,--how to detach the sensual sweet, the sensual\nstrong, the sensual bright, etc., from the moral sweet, the moral deep,\nthe moral fair; that is, again, to contrive to cut clean off this upper\nsurface so thin as to leave it bottomless; to get a one end, without an\nother end. The soul says, 'Eat;' the body would feast. The soul says,\n'The man and woman shall be one flesh and one soul;' the body would join\nthe flesh only. The soul says, 'Have dominion over all things to the\nends of virtue;' the body would have the power over things to its own\nends.\n\nThe soul strives amain to live and work through all things. It would\nbe the only fact. All things shall be added unto it,--power, pleasure,\nknowledge, beauty. The particular man aims to be somebody; to set up for\nhimself; to truck and higgle for a private good; and, in particulars, to\nride that he may ride; to dress that he may be dressed; to eat that he\nmay eat; and to govern, that he may be seen. Men seek to be great; they\nwould have offices, wealth, power, and fame. They think that to be great\nis to possess one side of nature,--the sweet, without the other side,\nthe bitter.\n\nThis dividing and detaching is steadily counteracted. Up to this day\nit must be owned no projector has had the smallest success. The parted\nwater reunites behind our hand. Pleasure is taken out of pleasant\nthings, profit out of profitable things, power out of strong things, as\nsoon as we seek to separate them from the whole. We can no more halve\nthings and get the sensual good, by itself, than we can get an inside\nthat shall have no outside, or a light without a shadow. \"Drive out\nNature with a fork, she comes running back.\"\n\nLife invests itself with inevitable conditions, which the unwise seek to\ndodge, which one and another brags that he does not know, that they do\nnot touch him;--but the brag is on his lips, the conditions are in his\nsoul. If he escapes them in one part they attack him in another more\nvital part. If he has escaped them in form and in the appearance, it\nis because he has resisted his life and fled from himself, and the\nretribution is so much death. So signal is the failure of all attempts\nto make this separation of the good from the tax, that the experiment\nwould not be tried,--since to try it is to be mad,--but for the\ncircumstance, that when the disease began in the will, of rebellion and\nseparation, the intellect is at once infected, so that the man ceases to\nsee God whole in each object, but is able to see the sensual allurement\nof an object and not see the sensual hurt; he sees the mermaid's head\nbut not the dragon's tail, and thinks he can cut off that which he\nwould have from that which he would not have. \"How secret art thou\nwho dwellest in the highest heavens in silence, O thou only great God,\nsprinkling with an unwearied providence certain penal blindnesses upon\nsuch as have unbridled desires!\" {1}\n\n     1 St. Augustine, Confessions, B. I.\n\nThe human soul is true to these facts in the painting of fable, of\nhistory, of law, of proverbs, of conversation. It finds a tongue in\nliterature unawares. Thus the Greeks called Jupiter, Supreme Mind;\nbut having traditionally ascribed to him many base actions, they\ninvoluntarily made amends to reason by tying up the hands of so bad a\ngod. He is made as helpless as a king of England. Prometheus knows one\nsecret which Jove must bargain for; Minerva, another. He cannot get his\nown thunders; Minerva keeps the key of them:--\n\n     \"Of all the gods, I only know the keys\n      That ope the solid doors within whose vaults\n      His thunders sleep.\"\n\nA plain confession of the in-working of the All and of its moral\naim. The Indian mythology ends in the same ethics; and it would seem\nimpossible for any fable to be invented and get any currency which was\nnot moral. Aurora forgot to ask youth for her lover, and though Tithonus\nis immortal, he is old. Achilles is not quite invulnerable; the sacred\nwaters did not wash the heel by which Thetis held him. Siegfried, in the\nNibelungen, is not quite immortal, for a leaf fell on his back whilst\nhe was bathing in the dragon's blood, and that spot which it covered is\nmortal. And so it must be. There is a crack in every thing God has made.\nIt would seem there is always this vindictive circumstance stealing in\nat unawares even into the wild poesy in which the human fancy attempted\nto make bold holiday and to shake itself free of the old laws,--this\nback-stroke, this kick of the gun, certifying that the law is fatal;\nthat in nature nothing can be given, all things are sold.\n\nThis is that ancient doctrine of Nemesis, who keeps watch in the\nuniverse and lets no offence go unchastised. The Furies they said are\nattendants on justice, and if the sun in heaven should transgress his\npath they would punish him. The poets related that stone walls and iron\nswords and leathern thongs had an occult sympathy with the wrongs of\ntheir owners; that the belt which Ajax gave Hector dragged the Trojan\nhero over the field at the wheels of the car of Achilles, and the sword\nwhich Hector gave Ajax was that on whose point Ajax fell. They recorded\nthat when the Thasians erected a statue to Theagenes, a victor in the\ngames, one of his rivals went to it by night and endeavored to throw it\ndown by repeated blows, until at last he moved it from its pedestal and\nwas crushed to death beneath its fall.\n\nThis voice of fable has in it somewhat divine. It came from thought\nabove the will of the writer. That is the best part of each writer\nwhich has nothing private in it; that which he does not know; that which\nflowed out of his constitution and not from his too active invention;\nthat which in the study of a single artist you might not easily find,\nbut in the study of many you would abstract as the spirit of them all.\nPhidias it is not, but the work of man in that early Hellenic world that\nI would know. The name and circumstance of Phidias, however convenient\nfor history, embarrass when we come to the highest criticism. We are\nto see that which man was tending to do in a given period, and was\nhindered, or, if you will, modified in doing, by the interfering\nvolitions of Phidias, of Dante, of Shakspeare, the organ whereby man at\nthe moment wrought.\n\nStill more striking is the expression of this fact in the proverbs\nof all nations, which are always the literature of reason, or the\nstatements of an absolute truth without qualification. Proverbs, like\nthe sacred books of each nation, are the sanctuary of the intuitions.\nThat which the droning world, chained to appearances, will not allow the\nrealist to say in his own words, it will suffer him to say in proverbs\nwithout contradiction. And this law of laws, which the pulpit, the\nsenate and the college deny, is hourly preached in all markets and\nworkshops by flights of proverbs, whose teaching is as true and as\nomnipresent as that of birds and flies.\n\nAll things are double, one against another.--Tit for tat; an eye for an\neye; a tooth for a tooth; blood for blood; measure for measure; love\nfor love.--Give and it shall be given you.--He that watereth shall be\nwatered himself.--What will you have? quoth God; pay for it and take\nit.--Nothing venture, nothing have.--Thou shalt be paid exactly for\nwhat thou hast done, no more, no less.--Who doth not work shall not\neat.--Harm watch, harm catch.--Curses always recoil on the head of him\nwho imprecates them.--If you put a chain around the neck of a slave,\nthe other end fastens itself around your own.--Bad counsel confounds the\nadviser.--The Devil is an ass.\n\nIt is thus written, because it is thus in life. Our action is\novermastered and characterized above our will by the law of nature.\nWe aim at a petty end quite aside from the public good, but our act\narranges itself by irresistible magnetism in a line with the poles of\nthe world.\n\nA man cannot speak but he judges himself. With his will or against his\nwill he draws his portrait to the eye of his companions by every word.\nEvery opinion reacts on him who utters it. It is a thread-ball thrown at\na mark, but the other end remains in the thrower's bag. Or rather it is\na harpoon hurled at the whale, unwinding, as it flies, a coil of cord in\nthe boat, and, if the harpoon is not good, or not well thrown, it will\ngo nigh to cut the steersman in twain or to sink the boat.\n\nYou cannot do wrong without suffering wrong. \"No man had ever a point\nof pride that was not injurious to him,\" said Burke. The exclusive in\nfashionable life does not see that he excludes himself from enjoyment,\nin the attempt to appropriate it. The exclusionist in religion does not\nsee that he shuts the door of heaven on himself, in striving to shut out\nothers. Treat men as pawns and ninepins and you shall suffer as well as\nthey. If you leave out their heart, you shall lose your own. The senses\nwould make things of all persons; of women, of children, of the poor.\nThe vulgar proverb, \"I will get it from his purse or get it from his\nskin,\" is sound philosophy.\n\nAll infractions of love and equity in our social relations are speedily\npunished. They are punished by fear. Whilst I stand in simple relations\nto my fellow-man, I have no displeasure in meeting him. We meet as water\nmeets water, or as two currents of air mix, with perfect diffusion and\ninterpenetration of nature. But as soon as there is any departure from\nsimplicity, and attempt at halfness, or good for me that is not good for\nhim, my neighbor feels the wrong; he shrinks from me as far as I have\nshrunk from him; his eyes no longer seek mine; there is war between us;\nthere is hate in him and fear in me.\n\nAll the old abuses in society, universal and particular, all unjust\naccumulations of property and power, are avenged in the same manner.\nFear is an instructor of great sagacity and the herald of all\nrevolutions. One thing he teaches, that there is rottenness where he\nappears. He is a carrion crow, and though you see not well what he\nhovers for, there is death somewhere. Our property is timid, our laws\nare timid, our cultivated classes are timid. Fear for ages has boded and\nmowed and gibbered over government and property. That obscene bird is\nnot there for nothing. He indicates great wrongs which must be revised.\n\nOf the like nature is that expectation of change which instantly follows\nthe suspension of our voluntary activity. The terror of cloudless noon,\nthe emerald of Polycrates, the awe of prosperity, the instinct\nwhich leads every generous soul to impose on itself tasks of a noble\nasceticism and vicarious virtue, are the tremblings of the balance of\njustice through the heart and mind of man.\n\nExperienced men of the world know very well that it is best to pay scot\nand lot as they go along, and that a man often pays dear for a small\nfrugality. The borrower runs in his own debt. Has a man gained any thing\nwho has received a hundred favors and rendered none? Has he gained\nby borrowing, through indolence or cunning, his neighbor's wares, or\nhorses, or money? There arises on the deed the instant acknowledgment\nof benefit on the one part and of debt on the other; that is, of\nsuperiority and inferiority. The transaction remains in the memory of\nhimself and his neighbor; and every new transaction alters according to\nits nature their relation to each other. He may soon come to see that\nhe had better have broken his own bones than to have ridden in his\nneighbor's coach, and that \"the highest price he can pay for a thing is\nto ask for it.\"\n\nA wise man will extend this lesson to all parts of life, and know that\nit is the part of prudence to face every claimant and pay every just\ndemand on your time, your talents, or your heart. Always pay; for first\nor last you must pay your entire debt. Persons and events may stand for\na time between you and justice, but it is only a postponement. You must\npay at last your own debt. If you are wise you will dread a prosperity\nwhich only loads you with more. Benefit is the end of nature. But\nfor every benefit which you receive, a tax is levied. He is great who\nconfers the most benefits. He is base,--and that is the one base thing\nin the universe,--to receive favors and render none. In the order of\nnature we cannot render benefits to those from whom we receive them, or\nonly seldom. But the benefit we receive must be rendered again, line for\nline, deed for deed, cent for cent, to somebody. Beware of too much good\nstaying in your hand. It will fast corrupt and worm worms. Pay it away\nquickly in some sort.\n\nLabor is watched over by the same pitiless laws. Cheapest, say the\nprudent, is the dearest labor. What we buy in a broom, a mat, a wagon, a\nknife, is some application of good sense to a common want. It is best\nto pay in your land a skilful gardener, or to buy good sense applied\nto gardening; in your sailor, good sense applied to navigation; in the\nhouse, good sense applied to cooking, sewing, serving; in your agent,\ngood sense applied to accounts and affairs. So do you multiply your\npresence, or spread yourself throughout your estate. But because of\nthe dual constitution of things, in labor as in life there can be no\ncheating. The thief steals from himself. The swindler swindles himself.\nFor the real price of labor is knowledge and virtue, whereof wealth and\ncredit are signs. These signs, like paper money, may be counterfeited\nor stolen, but that which they represent, namely, knowledge and virtue,\ncannot be counterfeited or stolen. These ends of labor cannot be\nanswered but by real exertions of the mind, and in obedience to pure\nmotives. The cheat, the defaulter, the gambler, cannot extort the\nknowledge of material and moral nature which his honest care and pains\nyield to the operative. The law of nature is, Do the thing, and you\nshall have the Power; but they who do not the thing have not the power.\n\nHuman labor, through all its forms, from the sharpening of a stake to\nthe construction of a city or an epic, is one immense illustration of\nthe perfect compensation of the universe. The absolute balance of Give\nand Take, the doctrine that every thing has its price,--and if that\nprice is not paid, not that thing but something else is obtained, and\nthat it is impossible to get any thing without its price,--is not less\nsublime in the columns of a leger than in the budgets of states, in the\nlaws of light and darkness, in all the action and reaction of nature. I\ncannot doubt that the high laws which each man sees implicated in those\nprocesses with which he is conversant, the stern ethics which sparkle\non his chisel-edge, which are measured out by his plumb and foot-rule,\nwhich stand as manifest in the footing of the shop-bill as in the\nhistory of a state,--do recommend to him his trade, and though seldom\nnamed, exalt his business to his imagination.\n\nThe league between virtue and nature engages all things to assume a\nhostile front to vice. The beautiful laws and substances of the world\npersecute and whip the traitor. He finds that things are arranged for\ntruth and benefit, but there is no den in the wide world to hide a\nrogue. Commit a crime, and the earth is made of glass. Commit a crime,\nand it seems as if a coat of snow fell on the ground, such as reveals\nin the woods the track of every partridge and fox and squirrel and mole.\nYou cannot recall the spoken word, you cannot wipe out the foot-track,\nyou cannot draw up the ladder, so as to leave no inlet or clew. Some\ndamning circumstance always transpires. The laws and substances of\nnature,--water, snow, wind, gravitation,--become penalties to the thief.\n\nOn the other hand the law holds with equal sureness for all right\naction. Love, and you shall be loved. All love is mathematically just,\nas much as the two sides of an algebraic equation. The good man has\nabsolute good, which like fire turns every thing to its own nature, so\nthat you cannot do him any harm; but as the royal armies sent against\nNapoleon, when he approached cast down their colors and from enemies\nbecame friends, so disasters of all kinds, as sickness, offence,\npoverty, prove benefactors:--\n\n                 \"Winds blow and waters roll\n         Strength to the brave, and power and deity,\n         Yet in themselves are nothing.\"\n\nThe good are befriended even by weakness and defect. As no man had ever\na point of pride that was not injurious to him, so no man had ever a\ndefect that was not somewhere made useful to him. The stag in the fable\nadmired his horns and blamed his feet, but when the hunter came,\nhis feet saved him, and afterwards, caught in the thicket, his horns\ndestroyed him. Every man in his lifetime needs to thank his faults. As\nno man thoroughly understands a truth until he has contended against it,\nso no man has a thorough acquaintance with the hindrances or talents of\nmen until he has suffered from the one and seen the triumph of the other\nover his own want of the same. Has he a defect of temper that unfits him\nto live in society? Thereby he is driven to entertain himself alone and\nacquire habits of self-help; and thus, like the wounded oyster, he mends\nhis shell with pearl.\n\nOur strength grows out of our weakness. The indignation which arms\nitself with secret forces does not awaken until we are pricked and stung\nand sorely assailed. A great man is always willing to be little. Whilst\nhe sits on the cushion of advantages, he goes to sleep. When he is\npushed, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn something; he has\nbeen put on his wits, on his manhood; he has gained facts; learns his\nignorance; is cured of the insanity of conceit; has got moderation and\nreal skill. The wise man throws himself on the side of his assailants.\nIt is more his interest than it is theirs to find his weak point. The\nwound cicatrizes and falls off from him like a dead skin and when they\nwould triumph, lo! he has passed on invulnerable. Blame is safer than\npraise. I hate to be defended in a newspaper. As long as all that is\nsaid is said against me, I feel a certain assurance of success. But as\nsoon as honeyed words of praise are spoken for me I feel as one that\nlies unprotected before his enemies. In general, every evil to which we\ndo not succumb is a benefactor. As the Sandwich Islander believes that\nthe strength and valor of the enemy he kills passes into himself, so we\ngain the strength of the temptation we resist.\n\nThe same guards which protect us from disaster, defect, and enmity,\ndefend us, if we will, from selfishness and fraud. Bolts and bars are\nnot the best of our institutions, nor is shrewdness in trade a mark of\nwisdom. Men suffer all their life long under the foolish superstition\nthat they can be cheated. But it is as impossible for a man to be\ncheated by any one but himself, as for a thing to be and not to be at\nthe same time. There is a third silent party to all our bargains. The\nnature and soul of things takes on itself the guaranty of the fulfilment\nof every contract, so that honest service cannot come to loss. If you\nserve an ungrateful master, serve him the more. Put God in your debt.\nEvery stroke shall be repaid. The longer The payment is withholden, the\nbetter for you; for compound interest on compound interest is the rate\nand usage of this exchequer.\n\nThe history of persecution is a history of endeavors to cheat nature, to\nmake water run up hill, to twist a rope of sand. It makes no difference\nwhether the actors be many or one, a tyrant or a mob. A mob is a society\nof bodies voluntarily bereaving themselves of reason and traversing its\nwork. The mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast.\nIts fit hour of activity is night. Its actions are insane like its whole\nconstitution. It persecutes a principle; it would whip a right; it would\ntar and feather justice, by inflicting fire and outrage upon the houses\nand persons of those who have these. It resembles the prank of boys,\nwho run with fire-engines to put out the ruddy aurora streaming to the\nstars. The inviolate spirit turns their spite against the wrongdoers.\nThe martyr cannot be dishonored. Every lash inflicted is a tongue of\nfame; every prison, a more illustrious abode; every burned book or house\nenlightens the world; every suppressed or expunged word reverberates\nthrough the earth from side to side. Hours of sanity and consideration\nare always arriving to communities, as to individuals, when the truth is\nseen and the martyrs are justified.\n\nThus do all things preach the indifferency of circumstances. The man is\nall. Every thing has two sides, a good and an evil. Every advantage has\nits tax. I learn to be content. But the doctrine of compensation is\nnot the doctrine of indifferency. The thoughtless say, on hearing these\nrepresentations,--What boots it to do well? there is one event to good\nand evil; if I gain any good I must pay for it; if I lose any good I\ngain some other; all actions are indifferent.\n\nThere is a deeper fact in the soul than compensation, to wit, its own\nnature. The soul is not a compensation, but a life. The soul is. Under\nall this running sea of circumstance, whose waters ebb and flow with\nperfect balance, lies the aboriginal abyss of real Being. Essence,\nor God, is not a relation or a part, but the whole. Being is the vast\naffirmative, excluding negation, self-balanced, and swallowing up all\nrelations, parts and times within itself. Nature, truth, virtue, are\nthe influx from thence. Vice is the absence or departure of the same.\nNothing, Falsehood, may indeed stand as the great Night or shade on\nwhich as a background the living universe paints itself forth, but no\nfact is begotten by it; it cannot work, for it is not. It cannot work\nany good; it cannot work any harm. It is harm inasmuch as it is worse\nnot to be than to be.\n\nWe feel defrauded of the retribution due to evil acts, because the\ncriminal adheres to his vice and contumacy and does not come to a crisis\nor judgment anywhere in visible nature. There is no stunning confutation\nof his nonsense before men and angels. Has he therefore outwitted the\nlaw? Inasmuch as he carries the malignity and the lie with him he so far\ndeceases from nature. In some manner there will be a demonstration of\nthe wrong to the understanding also; but, should we not see it, this\ndeadly deduction makes square the eternal account.\n\nNeither can it be said, on the other hand, that the gain of rectitude\nmust be bought by any loss. There is no penalty to virtue; no penalty\nto wisdom; they are proper additions of being. In a virtuous action I\nproperly am; in a virtuous act I add to the world; I plant into deserts\nconquered from Chaos and Nothing and see the darkness receding on\nthe limits of the horizon. There can be no excess to love, none to\nknowledge, none to beauty, when these attributes are considered in the\npurest sense. The soul refuses limits, and always affirms an Optimism,\nnever a Pessimism.\n\nHis life is a progress, and not a station. His instinct is trust. Our\ninstinct uses \"more\" and \"less\" in application to man, of the presence\nof the soul, and not of its absence, the brave man is greater than the\ncoward; the true, the benevolent, the wise, is more a man and not less,\nthan the fool and knave. There is no tax on the good of virtue, for\nthat is the incoming of God himself, or absolute existence, without any\ncomparative. Material good has its tax, and if it came without desert or\nsweat, has no root in me, and the next wind will blow it away. But all\nthe good of nature is the soul's, and may be had if paid for in nature's\nlawful coin, that is, by labor which the heart and the head allow. I no\nlonger wish to meet a good I do not earn, for example to find a pot of\nburied gold, knowing that it brings with it new burdens. I do not wish\nmore external goods,--neither possessions, nor honors, nor powers, nor\npersons. The gain is apparent; the tax is certain. But there is no\ntax on the knowledge that the compensation exists and that it is not\ndesirable to dig up treasure. Herein I rejoice with a serene eternal\npeace. I contract the boundaries of possible mischief. I learn the\nwisdom of St. Bernard,--\"Nothing can work me damage except myself; the\nharm that I sustain I carry about with me, and never am a real sufferer\nbut by my own fault.\"\n\nIn the nature of the soul is the compensation for the inequalities of\ncondition. The radical tragedy of nature seems to be the distinction of\nMore and Less. How can Less not feel the pain; how not feel indignation\nor malevolence towards More? Look at those who have less faculty, and\none feels sad and knows not well what to make of it. He almost shuns\ntheir eye; he fears they will upbraid God. What should they do? It\nseems a great injustice. But see the facts nearly and these mountainous\ninequalities vanish. Love reduces them as the sun melts the iceberg in\nthe sea. The heart and soul of all men being one, this bitterness of His\nand Mine ceases. His is mine. I am my brother and my brother is me. If I\nfeel overshadowed and outdone by great neighbors, I can yet love; I can\nstill receive; and he that loveth maketh his own the grandeur he loves.\nThereby I make the discovery that my brother is my guardian, acting for\nme with the friendliest designs, and the estate I so admired and envied\nis my own. It is the nature of the soul to appropriate all things. Jesus\nand Shakspeare are fragments of the soul, and by love I conquer and\nincorporate them in my own conscious domain. His virtue,--is not that\nmine? His wit,--if it cannot be made mine, it is not wit.\n\nSuch also is the natural history of calamity. The changes which break up\nat short intervals the prosperity of men are advertisements of a nature\nwhose law is growth. Every soul is by this intrinsic necessity quitting\nits whole system of things, its friends and home and laws and faith, as\nthe shell-fish crawls out of its beautiful but stony case, because it no\nlonger admits of its growth, and slowly forms a new house. In proportion\nto the vigor of the individual these revolutions are frequent, until in\nsome happier mind they are incessant and all worldly relations hang\nvery loosely about him, becoming as it were a transparent fluid membrane\nthrough which the living form is seen, and not, as in most men,\nan indurated heterogeneous fabric of many dates and of no settled\ncharacter, in which the man is imprisoned. Then there can be\nenlargement, and the man of to-day scarcely recognizes the man of\nyesterday. And such should be the outward biography of man in time, a\nputting off of dead circumstances day by day, as he renews his raiment\nday by day. But to us, in our lapsed estate, resting, not advancing,\nresisting, not cooperating with the divine expansion, this growth comes\nby shocks.\n\nWe cannot part with our friends. We cannot let our angels go. We do not\nsee that they only go out that archangels may come in. We are idolaters\nof the old. We do not believe in the riches of the soul, in its proper\neternity and omnipresence. We do not believe there is any force in\nto-day to rival or recreate that beautiful yesterday. We linger in the\nruins of the old tent where once we had bread and shelter and organs,\nnor believe that the spirit can feed, cover, and nerve us again. We\ncannot again find aught so dear, so sweet, so graceful. But we sit\nand weep in vain. The voice of the Almighty saith, 'Up and onward for\nevermore!' We cannot stay amid the ruins. Neither will we rely on the\nnew; and so we walk ever with reverted eyes, like those monsters who\nlook backwards.\n\nAnd yet the compensations of calamity are made apparent to the\nunderstanding also, after long intervals of time. A fever, a mutilation,\na cruel disappointment, a loss of wealth, a loss of friends, seems at\nthe moment unpaid loss, and unpayable. But the sure years reveal the\ndeep remedial force that underlies all facts. The death of a dear\nfriend, wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing but privation,\nsomewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or genius; for it commonly\noperates revolutions in our way of life, terminates an epoch of\ninfancy or of youth which was waiting to be closed, breaks up a wonted\noccupation, or a household, or style of living, and allows the formation\nof new ones more friendly to the growth of character. It permits or\nconstrains the formation of new acquaintances and the reception of new\ninfluences that prove of the first importance to the next years; and the\nman or woman who would have remained a sunny garden-flower, with no room\nfor its roots and too much sunshine for its head, by the falling of the\nwalls and the neglect of the gardener is made the banian of the forest,\nyielding shade and fruit to wide neighborhoods of men.\n\n*****\n\n\n\n     SPIRITUAL LAWS.\n\n     The living Heaven thy prayers respect,\n     House at once and architect,\n     Quarrying man's rejected hours,\n     Builds therewith eternal towers;\n     Sole and self-commanded works,\n     Fears not undermining days,\n     Grows by decays,\n     And, by the famous might that lurks\n     In reaction and recoil,\n     Makes flame to freeze, and ice to boil;\n     Forging, through swart arms of Offence,\n     The silver seat of Innocence.\n\n\n\n\nIV. SPIRITUAL LAWS.\n\nWhen the act of reflection takes place in the mind, when we look\nat ourselves in the light of thought, we discover that our life is\nembosomed in beauty. Behind us, as we go, all things assume pleasing\nforms, as clouds do far off. Not only things familiar and stale, but\neven the tragic and terrible are comely as they take their place in the\npictures of memory. The river-bank, the weed at the water-side, the\nold house, the foolish person, however neglected in the passing, have\na grace in the past. Even the corpse that has lain in the chambers has\nadded a solemn ornament to the house. The soul will not know either\ndeformity or pain. If in the hours of clear reason we should speak the\nseverest truth, we should say that we had never made a sacrifice. In\nthese hours the mind seems so great that nothing can be taken from us\nthat seems much. All loss, all pain, is particular; the universe remains\nto the heart unhurt. Neither vexations nor calamities abate our\ntrust. No man ever stated his griefs as lightly as he might. Allow for\nexaggeration in the most patient and sorely ridden hack that ever was\ndriven. For it is only the finite that has wrought and suffered; the\ninfinite lies stretched in smiling repose.\n\nThe intellectual life may be kept clean and healthful if man will live\nthe life of nature and not import into his mind difficulties which are\nnone of his. No man need be perplexed in his speculations. Let him do\nand say what strictly belongs to him, and though very ignorant of books,\nhis nature shall not yield him any intellectual obstructions and doubts.\nOur young people are diseased with the theological problems of original\nsin, origin of evil, predestination and the like. These never presented\na practical difficulty to any man,--never darkened across any man's road\nwho did not go out of his way to seek them. These are the soul's mumps\nand measles and whooping-coughs, and those who have not caught them\ncannot describe their health or prescribe the cure. A simple mind will\nnot know these enemies. It is quite another thing that he should be able\nto give account of his faith and expound to another the theory of his\nself-union and freedom. This requires rare gifts. Yet without this\nself-knowledge there may be a sylvan strength and integrity in that\nwhich he is. \"A few strong instincts and a few plain rules\" suffice us.\n\nMy will never gave the images in my mind the rank they now take. The\nregular course of studies, the years of academical and professional\neducation have not yielded me better facts than some idle books under\nthe bench at the Latin School. What we do not call education is more\nprecious than that which we call so. We form no guess, at the time\nof receiving a thought, of its comparative value. And education often\nwastes its effort in attempts to thwart and balk this natural magnetism,\nwhich is sure to select what belongs to it.\n\nIn like manner our moral nature is vitiated by any interference of our\nwill. People represent virtue as a struggle, and take to themselves\ngreat airs upon their attainments, and the question is everywhere vexed\nwhen a noble nature is commended, whether the man is not better who\nstrives with temptation. But there is no merit in the matter. Either God\nis there or he is not there. We love characters in proportion as they\nare impulsive and spontaneous. The less a man thinks or knows about\nhis virtues the better we like him. Timoleon's victories are the best\nvictories, which ran and flowed like Homer's verses, Plutarch said. When\nwe see a soul whose acts are all regal, graceful and pleasant as roses,\nwe must thank God that such things can be and are, and not turn sourly\non the angel and say 'Crump is a better man with his grunting resistance\nto all his native devils.'\n\nNot less conspicuous is the preponderance of nature over will in all\npractical life. There is less intention in history than we ascribe to\nit. We impute deep-laid far-sighted plans to Caesar and Napoleon;\nbut the best of their power was in nature, not in them. Men of an\nextraordinary success, in their honest moments, have always sung, 'Not\nunto us, not unto us.' According to the faith of their times they have\nbuilt altars to Fortune, or to Destiny, or to St. Julian. Their success\nlay in their parallelism to the course of thought, which found in them\nan unobstructed channel; and the wonders of which they were the visible\nconductors seemed to the eye their deed. Did the wires generate the\ngalvanism? It is even true that there was less in them on which they\ncould reflect than in another; as the virtue of a pipe is to be smooth\nand hollow. That which externally seemed will and immovableness was\nwillingness and self-annihilation. Could Shakspeare give a theory of\nShakspeare? Could ever a man of prodigious mathematical genius convey to\nothers any insight into his methods? If he could communicate that\nsecret it would instantly lose its exaggerated value, blending with the\ndaylight and the vital energy the power to stand and to go.\n\nThe lesson is forcibly taught by these observations that our life might\nbe much easier and simpler than we make it; that the world might be\na happier place than it is; that there is no need of struggles,\nconvulsions, and despairs, of the wringing of the hands and the gnashing\nof the teeth; that we miscreate our own evils. We interfere with the\noptimism of nature; for whenever we get this vantage-ground of the past,\nor of a wiser mind in the present, we are able to discern that we are\nbegirt with laws which execute themselves.\n\nThe face of external nature teaches the same lesson. Nature will not\nhave us fret and fume. She does not like our benevolence or our learning\nmuch better than she likes our frauds and wars. When we come out of\nthe caucus, or the bank, or the Abolition-convention, or the\nTemperance-meeting, or the Transcendental club into the fields and\nwoods, she says to us, 'So hot? my little Sir.'\n\nWe are full of mechanical actions. We must needs intermeddle and have\nthings in our own way, until the sacrifices and virtues of society\nare odious. Love should make joy; but our benevolence is unhappy. Our\nSunday-schools and churches and pauper-societies are yokes to the neck.\nWe pain ourselves to please nobody. There are natural ways of arriving\nat the same ends at which these aim, but do not arrive. Why should all\nvirtue work in one and the same way? Why should all give dollars? It is\nvery inconvenient to us country folk, and we do not think any good will\ncome of it. We have not dollars; merchants have; let them give them.\nFarmers will give corn; poets will sing; women will sew; laborers will\nlend a hand; the children will bring flowers. And why drag this dead\nweight of a Sunday-school over the whole Christendom? It is natural and\nbeautiful that childhood should inquire and maturity should teach; but\nit is time enough to answer questions when they are asked. Do not shut\nup the young people against their will in a pew and force the children\nto ask them questions for an hour against their will.\n\nIf we look wider, things are all alike; laws and letters and creeds and\nmodes of living seem a travesty of truth. Our society is encumbered by\nponderous machinery, which resembles the endless aqueducts which\nthe Romans built over hill and dale and which are superseded by the\ndiscovery of the law that water rises to the level of its source. It is\na Chinese wall which any nimble Tartar can leap over. It is a standing\narmy, not so good as a peace. It is a graduated, titled, richly\nappointed empire, quite superfluous when town-meetings are found to\nanswer just as well.\n\nLet us draw a lesson from nature, which always works by short ways.\nWhen the fruit is ripe, it falls. When the fruit is despatched, the leaf\nfalls. The circuit of the waters is mere falling. The walking of man\nand all animals is a falling forward. All our manual labor and works of\nstrength, as prying, splitting, digging, rowing and so forth, are done\nby dint of continual falling, and the globe, earth, moon, comet, sun,\nstar, fall for ever and ever.\n\nThe simplicity of the universe is very different from the simplicity of\na machine. He who sees moral nature out and out and thoroughly knows how\nknowledge is acquired and character formed, is a pedant. The simplicity\nof nature is not that which may easily be read, but is inexhaustible.\nThe last analysis can no wise be made. We judge of a man's wisdom by his\nhope, knowing that the perception of the inexhaustibleness of nature is\nan immortal youth. The wild fertility of nature is felt in comparing our\nrigid names and reputations with our fluid consciousness. We pass in the\nworld for sects and schools, for erudition and piety, and we are all the\ntime jejune babes. One sees very well how Pyrrhonism grew up. Every man\nsees that he is that middle point whereof every thing may be affirmed\nand denied with equal reason. He is old, he is young, he is very wise,\nhe is altogether ignorant. He hears and feels what you say of the\nseraphim, and of the tin-peddler. There is no permanent wise man except\nin the figment of the Stoics. We side with the hero, as we read or\npaint, against the coward and the robber; but we have been ourselves\nthat coward and robber, and shall be again,--not in the low\ncircumstance, but in comparison with the grandeurs possible to the soul.\n\nA little consideration of what takes place around us every day would\nshow us that a higher law than that of our will regulates events; that\nour painful labors are unnecessary and fruitless; that only in our easy,\nsimple, spontaneous action are we strong, and by contenting ourselves\nwith obedience we become divine. Belief and love,--a believing love will\nrelieve us of a vast load of care. O my brothers, God exists. There is\na soul at the centre of nature and over the will of every man, so\nthat none of us can wrong the universe. It has so infused its strong\nenchantment into nature that we prosper when we accept its advice,\nand when we struggle to wound its creatures our hands are glued to our\nsides, or they beat our own breasts. The whole course of things goes to\nteach us faith. We need only obey. There is guidance for each of us, and\nby lowly listening we shall hear the right word. Why need you choose so\npainfully your place and occupation and associates and modes of action\nand of entertainment? Certainly there is a possible right for you that\nprecludes the need of balance and wilful election. For you there is a\nreality, a fit place and congenial duties. Place yourself in the middle\nof the stream of power and wisdom which animates all whom it floats,\nand you are without effort impelled to truth, to right and a perfect\ncontentment. Then you put all gainsayers in the wrong. Then you are\nthe world, the measure of right, of truth, of beauty. If we will not\nbe mar-plots with our miserable interferences, the work, the society,\nletters, arts, science, religion of men would go on far better than\nnow, and the heaven predicted from the beginning of the world, and still\npredicted from the bottom of the heart, would organize itself, as do now\nthe rose and the air and the sun.\n\nI say, do not choose; but that is a figure of speech by which I would\ndistinguish what is commonly called choice among men, and which is a\npartial act, the choice of the hands, of the eyes, of the appetites, and\nnot a whole act of the man. But that which I call right or goodness,\nis the choice of my constitution; and that which I call heaven, and\ninwardly aspire after, is the state or circumstance desirable to my\nconstitution; and the action which I in all my years tend to do, is the\nwork for my faculties. We must hold a man amenable to reason for the\nchoice of his daily craft or profession. It is not an excuse any longer\nfor his deeds that they are the custom of his trade. What business has\nhe with an evil trade? Has he not a calling in his character?\n\nEach man has his own vocation. The talent is the call. There is one\ndirection in which all space is open to him. He has faculties silently\ninviting him thither to endless exertion. He is like a ship in a river;\nhe runs against obstructions on every side but one, on that side all\nobstruction is taken away and he sweeps serenely over a deepening\nchannel into an infinite sea. This talent and this call depend on his\norganization, or the mode in which the general soul incarnates itself in\nhim. He inclines to do something which is easy to him and good when it\nis done, but which no other man can do. He has no rival. For the more\ntruly he consults his own powers, the more difference will his work\nexhibit from the work of any other. His ambition is exactly proportioned\nto his powers. The height of the pinnacle is determined by the breadth\nof the base. Every man has this call of the power to do somewhat unique,\nand no man has any other call. The pretence that he has another call, a\nsummons by name and personal election and outward \"signs that mark him\nextraordinary, and not in the roll of common men,\" is fanaticism,\nand betrays obtuseness to perceive that there is one mind in all the\nindividuals, and no respect of persons therein.\n\nBy doing his work he makes the need felt which he can supply, and\ncreates the taste by which he is enjoyed. By doing his own work he\nunfolds himself. It is the vice of our public speaking that it has not\nabandonment. Somewhere, not only every orator but every man should let\nout all the length of all the reins; should find or make a frank and\nhearty expression of what force and meaning is in him. The common\nexperience is that the man fits himself as well as he can to the\ncustomary details of that work or trade he falls into, and tends it as a\ndog turns a spit. Then is he a part of the machine he moves; the man is\nlost. Until he can manage to communicate himself to others in his full\nstature and proportion, he does not yet find his vocation. He must find\nin that an outlet for his character, so that he may justify his work to\ntheir eyes. If the labor is mean, let him by his thinking and character\nmake it liberal. Whatever he knows and thinks, whatever in his\napprehension is worth doing, that let him communicate, or men will never\nknow and honor him aright. Foolish, whenever you take the meanness\nand formality of that thing you do, instead of converting it into the\nobedient spiracle of your character and aims.\n\nWe like only such actions as have already long had the praise of men,\nand do not perceive that any thing man can do may be divinely done.\nWe think greatness entailed or organized in some places or duties, in\ncertain offices or occasions, and do not see that Paganini can\nextract rapture from a catgut, and Eulenstein from a jews-harp, and\na nimble-fingered lad out of shreds of paper with his scissors, and\nLandseer out of swine, and the hero out of the pitiful habitation and\ncompany in which he was hidden. What we call obscure condition or vulgar\nsociety is that condition and society whose poetry is not yet written,\nbut which you shall presently make as enviable and renowned as any. In\nour estimates let us take a lesson from kings. The parts of hospitality,\nthe connection of families, the impressiveness of death, and a thousand\nother things, royalty makes its own estimate of, and a royal mind will.\nTo make habitually a new estimate,--that is elevation.\n\nWhat a man does, that he has. What has he to do with hope or fear? In\nhimself is his might. Let him regard no good as solid but that which is\nin his nature and which must grow out of him as long as he exists. The\ngoods of fortune may come and go like summer leaves; let him\nscatter them on every wind as the momentary signs of his infinite\nproductiveness.\n\nHe may have his own. A man's genius, the quality that differences him\nfrom every other, the susceptibility to one class of influences, the\nselection of what is fit for him, the rejection of what is unfit,\ndetermines for him the character of the universe. A man is a method, a\nprogressive arrangement; a selecting principle, gathering his like to\nhim wherever he goes. He takes only his own out of the multiplicity that\nsweeps and circles round him. He is like one of those booms which\nare set out from the shore on rivers to catch drift-wood, or like the\nloadstone amongst splinters of steel. Those facts, words, persons, which\ndwell in his memory without his being able to say why, remain\nbecause they have a relation to him not less real for being as yet\nunapprehended. They are symbols of value to him as they can interpret\nparts of his consciousness which he would vainly seek words for in the\nconventional images of books and other minds. What attracts my attention\nshall have it, as I will go to the man who knocks at my door, whilst\na thousand persons as worthy go by it, to whom I give no regard. It is\nenough that these particulars speak to me. A few anecdotes, a few traits\nof character, manners, face, a few incidents, have an emphasis in your\nmemory out of all proportion to their apparent significance if you\nmeasure them by the ordinary standards. They relate to your gift.\nLet them have their weight, and do not reject them and cast about for\nillustration and facts more usual in literature. What your heart thinks\ngreat is great. The soul's emphasis is always right.\n\nOver all things that are agreeable to his nature and genius the man has\nthe highest right. Everywhere he may take what belongs to his spiritual\nestate, nor can he take any thing else though all doors were open, nor\ncan all the force of men hinder him from taking so much. It is vain to\nattempt to keep a secret from one who has a right to know it. It will\ntell itself. That mood into which a friend can bring us is his dominion\nover us. To the thoughts of that state of mind he has a right. All\nthe secrets of that state of mind he can compel. This is a law which\nstatesmen use in practice. All the terrors of the French Republic, which\nheld Austria in awe, were unable to command her diplomacy. But Napoleon\nsent to Vienna M. de Narbonne, one of the old noblesse, with the morals,\nmanners and name of that interest, saying that it was indispensable to\nsend to the old aristocracy of Europe men of the same connection, which,\nin fact, constitutes a sort of free-masonry. M. de Narbonne in less than\na fortnight penetrated all the secrets of the imperial cabinet.\n\nNothing seems so easy as to speak and to be understood. Yet a man may\ncome to find that the strongest of defences and of ties,--that he has\nbeen understood; and he who has received an opinion may come to find it\nthe most inconvenient of bonds.\n\nIf a teacher have any opinion which he wishes to conceal, his pupils\nwill become as fully indoctrinated into that as into any which he\npublishes. If you pour water into a vessel twisted into coils and\nangles, it is vain to say, I will pour it only into this or that;--it\nwill find its level in all. Men feel and act the consequences of your\ndoctrine without being able to show how they follow. Show us an arc of\nthe curve, and a good mathematician will find out the whole figure.\nWe are always reasoning from the seen to the unseen. Hence the perfect\nintelligence that subsists between wise men of remote ages. A man cannot\nbury his meanings so deep in his book but time and like-minded men\nwill find them. Plato had a secret doctrine, had he? What secret can\nhe conceal from the eyes of Bacon? of Montaigne? of Kant? Therefore,\nAristotle said of his works, \"They are published and not published.\"\n\nNo man can learn what he has not preparation for learning, however near\nto his eyes is the object. A chemist may tell his most precious secrets\nto a carpenter, and he shall be never the wiser,--the secrets he would\nnot utter to a chemist for an estate. God screens us evermore from\npremature ideas. Our eyes are holden that we cannot see things that\nstare us in the face, until the hour arrives when the mind is ripened;\nthen we behold them, and the time when we saw them not is like a dream.\n\nNot in nature but in man is all the beauty and worth he sees. The world\nis very empty, and is indebted to this gilding, exalting soul for all\nits pride. \"Earth fills her lap with splendors\" not her own. The vale of\nTempe, Tivoli and Rome are earth and water, rocks and sky. There are as\ngood earth and water in a thousand places, yet how unaffecting!\n\nPeople are not the better for the sun and moon, the horizon and the\ntrees; as it is not observed that the keepers of Roman galleries or the\nvalets of painters have any elevation of thought, or that librarians are\nwiser men than others. There are graces in the demeanor of a polished\nand noble person which are lost upon the eye of a churl. These are like\nthe stars whose light has not yet reached us.\n\nHe may see what he maketh. Our dreams are the sequel of our waking\nknowledge. The visions of the night bear some proportion to the visions\nof the day. Hideous dreams are exaggerations of the sins of the day. We\nsee our evil affections embodied in bad physiognomies. On the Alps the\ntraveller sometimes beholds his own shadow magnified to a giant, so that\nevery gesture of his hand is terrific. \"My children,\" said an old man\nto his boys scared by a figure in the dark entry, \"my children, you\nwill never see any thing worse than yourselves.\" As in dreams, so in\nthe scarcely less fluid events of the world every man sees himself in\ncolossal, without knowing that it is himself. The good, compared to the\nevil which he sees, is as his own good to his own evil. Every quality of\nhis mind is magnified in some one acquaintance, and every emotion of\nhis heart in some one. He is like a quincunx of trees, which counts\nfive,--east, west, north, or south; or an initial, medial, and terminal\nacrostic. And why not? He cleaves to one person and avoids another,\naccording to their likeness or unlikeness to himself, truly seeking\nhimself in his associates and moreover in his trade and habits and\ngestures and meats and drinks, and comes at last to be faithfully\nrepresented by every view you take of his circumstances.\n\nHe may read what he writes. What can we see or acquire but what we are?\nYou have observed a skilful man reading Virgil. Well, that author is a\nthousand books to a thousand persons. Take the book into your two\nhands and read your eyes out, you will never find what I find. If any\ningenious reader would have a monopoly of the wisdom or delight he gets,\nhe is as secure now the book is Englished, as if it were imprisoned in\nthe Pelews' tongue. It is with a good book as it is with good company.\nIntroduce a base person among gentlemen, it is all to no purpose; he\nis not their fellow. Every society protects itself. The company is\nperfectly safe, and he is not one of them, though his body is in the\nroom.\n\nWhat avails it to fight with the eternal laws of mind, which adjust the\nrelation of all persons to each other by the mathematical measure of\ntheir havings and beings? Gertrude is enamored of Guy; how high, how\naristocratic, how Roman his mien and manners! to live with him were life\nindeed, and no purchase is too great; and heaven and earth are moved\nto that end. Well, Gertrude has Guy; but what now avails how high, how\naristocratic, how Roman his mien and manners, if his heart and aims are\nin the senate, in the theatre and in the billiard-room, and she has no\naims, no conversation that can enchant her graceful lord?\n\nHe shall have his own society. We can love nothing but nature. The most\nwonderful talents, the most meritorious exertions really avail very\nlittle with us; but nearness or likeness of nature,--how beautiful is\nthe ease of its victory! Persons approach us, famous for their beauty,\nfor their accomplishments, worthy of all wonder for their charms\nand gifts; they dedicate their whole skill to the hour and the\ncompany,--with very imperfect result. To be sure it would be ungrateful\nin us not to praise them loudly. Then, when all is done, a person of\nrelated mind, a brother or sister by nature, comes to us so softly and\neasily, so nearly and intimately, as if it were the blood in our proper\nveins, that we feel as if some one was gone, instead of another having\ncome; we are utterly relieved and refreshed; it is a sort of joyful\nsolitude. We foolishly think in our days of sin that we must court\nfriends by compliance to the customs of society, to its dress, its\nbreeding, and its estimates. But only that soul can be my friend which\nI encounter on the line of my own march, that soul to which I do not\ndecline and which does not decline to me, but, native of the same\ncelestial latitude, repeats in its own all my experience. The scholar\nforgets himself and apes the customs and costumes of the man of the\nworld to deserve the smile of beauty, and follows some giddy girl, not\nyet taught by religious passion to know the noble woman with all that is\nserene, oracular and beautiful in her soul. Let him be great, and love\nshall follow him. Nothing is more deeply punished than the neglect of\nthe affinities by which alone society should be formed, and the insane\nlevity of choosing associates by others' eyes.\n\nHe may set his own rate. It is a maxim worthy of all acceptation that a\nman may have that allowance he takes. Take the place and attitude which\nbelong to you, and all men acquiesce. The world must be just. It\nleaves every man, with profound unconcern, to set his own rate. Hero or\ndriveller, it meddles not in the matter. It will certainly accept your\nown measure of your doing and being, whether you sneak about and deny\nyour own name, or whether you see your work produced to the concave\nsphere of the heavens, one with the revolution of the stars.\n\nThe same reality pervades all teaching. The man may teach by doing, and\nnot otherwise. If he can communicate himself he can teach, but not by\nwords. He teaches who gives, and he learns who receives. There is no\nteaching until the pupil is brought into the same state or principle in\nwhich you are; a transfusion takes place; he is you and you are he; then\nis a teaching, and by no unfriendly chance or bad company can he ever\nquite lose the benefit. But your propositions run out of one ear as they\nran in at the other. We see it advertised that Mr. Grand will deliver\nan oration on the Fourth of July, and Mr. Hand before the Mechanics'\nAssociation, and we do not go thither, because we know that these\ngentlemen will not communicate their own character and experience to\nthe company. If we had reason to expect such a confidence we should go\nthrough all inconvenience and opposition. The sick would be carried\nin litters. But a public oration is an escapade, a non-committal, an\napology, a gag, and not a communication, not a speech, not a man.\n\nA like Nemesis presides over all intellectual works. We have yet to\nlearn that the thing uttered in words is not therefore affirmed. It must\naffirm itself, or no forms of logic or of oath can give it evidence. The\nsentence must also contain its own apology for being spoken.\n\nThe effect of any writing on the public mind is mathematically\nmeasurable by its depth of thought. How much water does it draw? If it\nawaken you to think, if it lift you from your feet with the great voice\nof eloquence, then the effect is to be wide, slow, permanent, over the\nminds of men; if the pages instruct you not, they will die like flies in\nthe hour. The way to speak and write what shall not go out of fashion is\nto speak and write sincerely. The argument which has not power to reach\nmy own practice, I may well doubt will fail to reach yours. But take\nSidney's maxim:--\"Look in thy heart, and write.\" He that writes to\nhimself writes to an eternal public. That statement only is fit to be\nmade public which you have come at in attempting to satisfy your own\ncuriosity. The writer who takes his subject from his ear and not from\nhis heart, should know that he has lost as much as he seems to have\ngained, and when the empty book has gathered all its praise, and half\nthe people say, 'What poetry! what genius!' it still needs fuel to make\nfire. That only profits which is profitable. Life alone can impart life;\nand though we should burst we can only be valued as we make ourselves\nvaluable. There is no luck in literary reputation. They who make up the\nfinal verdict upon every book are not the partial and noisy readers of\nthe hour when it appears, but a court as of angels, a public not to be\nbribed, not to be entreated and not to be overawed, decides upon every\nman's title to fame. Only those books come down which deserve to last.\nGilt edges, vellum and morocco, and presentation-copies to all the\nlibraries will not preserve a book in circulation beyond its intrinsic\ndate. It must go with all Walpole's Noble and Royal Authors to its fate.\nBlackmore, Kotzebue, or Pollok may endure for a night, but Moses and\nHomer stand for ever. There are not in the world at any one time more\nthan a dozen persons who read and understand Plato,--never enough to\npay for an edition of his works; yet to every generation these come duly\ndown, for the sake of those few persons, as if God brought them in\nhis hand. \"No book,\" said Bentley, \"was ever written down by any but\nitself.\" The permanence of all books is fixed by no effort, friendly or\nhostile, but by their own specific gravity, or the intrinsic importance\nof their contents to the constant mind of man. \"Do not trouble yourself\ntoo much about the light on your statue,\" said Michael Angelo to the\nyoung sculptor; \"the light of the public square will test its value.\"\n\nIn like manner the effect of every action is measured by the depth of\nthe sentiment from which it proceeds. The great man knew not that he was\ngreat. It took a century or two for that fact to appear. What he did,\nhe did because he must; it was the most natural thing in the world, and\ngrew out of the circumstances of the moment. But now, every thing he\ndid, even to the lifting of his finger or the eating of bread, looks\nlarge, all-related, and is called an institution.\n\nThese are the demonstrations in a few particulars of the genius of\nnature; they show the direction of the stream. But the stream is blood;\nevery drop is alive. Truth has not single victories; all things are\nits organs,--not only dust and stones, but errors and lies. The laws\nof disease, physicians say, are as beautiful as the laws of health. Our\nphilosophy is affirmative and readily accepts the testimony of negative\nfacts, as every shadow points to the sun. By a divine necessity every\nfact in nature is constrained to offer its testimony.\n\nHuman character evermore publishes itself. The most fugitive deed and\nword, the mere air of doing a thing, the intimated purpose, expresses\ncharacter. If you act you show character; if you sit still, if you\nsleep, you show it. You think because you have spoken nothing when\nothers spoke, and have given no opinion on the times, on the church, on\nslavery, on marriage, on socialism, on secret societies, on the college,\non parties and persons, that your verdict is still expected with\ncuriosity as a reserved wisdom. Far otherwise; your silence answers very\nloud. You have no oracle to utter, and your fellow-men have learned\nthat you cannot help them; for oracles speak. Doth not Wisdom cry and\nUnderstanding put forth her voice?\n\nDreadful limits are set in nature to the powers of dissimulation. Truth\ntyrannizes over the unwilling members of the body. Faces never lie,\nit is said. No man need be deceived who will study the changes of\nexpression. When a man speaks the truth in the spirit of truth, his eye\nis as clear as the heavens. When he has base ends and speaks falsely,\nthe eye is muddy and sometimes asquint.\n\nI have heard an experienced counsellor say that he never feared the\neffect upon a jury of a lawyer who does not believe in his heart that\nhis client ought to have a verdict. If he does not believe it his\nunbelief will appear to the jury, despite all his protestations, and\nwill become their unbelief. This is that law whereby a work of art, of\nwhatever kind, sets us in the same state of mind wherein the artist was\nwhen he made it. That which we do not believe we cannot adequately say,\nthough we may repeat the words never so often. It was this conviction\nwhich Swedenborg expressed when he described a group of persons in the\nspiritual world endeavoring in vain to articulate a proposition which\nthey did not believe; but they could not, though they twisted and folded\ntheir lips even to indignation.\n\nA man passes for that he is worth. Very idle is all curiosity concerning\nother people's estimate of us, and all fear of remaining unknown is\nnot less so. If a man know that he can do any thing,--that he can do it\nbetter than any one else,--he has a pledge of the acknowledgment of that\nfact by all persons. The world is full of judgment-days, and into every\nassembly that a man enters, in every action he attempts, he is gauged\nand stamped. In every troop of boys that whoop and run in each yard and\nsquare, a new-comer is as well and accurately weighed in the course of\na few days and stamped with his right number, as if he had undergone a\nformal trial of his strength, speed and temper. A stranger comes from\na distant school, with better dress, with trinkets in his pockets, with\nairs and pretensions; an older boy says to himself, 'It's of no use;\nwe shall find him out to-morrow.' 'What has he done?' is the divine\nquestion which searches men and transpierces every false reputation. A\nfop may sit in any chair of the world nor be distinguished for his hour\nfrom Homer and Washington; but there need never be any doubt concerning\nthe respective ability of human beings. Pretension may sit still,\nbut cannot act. Pretension never feigned an act of real greatness.\nPretension never wrote an Iliad, nor drove back Xerxes, nor\nchristianized the world, nor abolished slavery.\n\nAs much virtue as there is, so much appears; as much goodness as there\nis, so much reverence it commands. All the devils respect virtue. The\nhigh, the generous, the self-devoted sect will always instruct and\ncommand mankind. Never was a sincere word utterly lost. Never a\nmagnanimity fell to the ground, but there is some heart to greet and\naccept it unexpectedly. A man passes for that he is worth. What he is\nengraves itself on his face, on his form, on his fortunes, in letters\nof light. Concealment avails him nothing, boasting nothing. There is\nconfession in the glances of our eyes, in our smiles, in salutations,\nand the grasp of hands. His sin bedaubs him, mars all his good\nimpression. Men know not why they do not trust him, but they do not\ntrust him. His vice glasses his eye, cuts lines of mean expression in\nhis cheek, pinches the nose, sets the mark of the beast on the back of\nthe head, and writes O fool! fool! on the forehead of a king.\n\nIf you would not be known to do any thing, never do it. A man may play\nthe fool in the drifts of a desert, but every grain of sand shall seem\nto see. He may be a solitary eater, but he cannot keep his foolish\ncounsel. A broken complexion, a swinish look, ungenerous acts and the\nwant of due knowledge,--all blab. Can a cook, a Chiffinch, an Iachimo\nbe mistaken for Zeno or Paul? Confucius exclaimed,--\"How can a man be\nconcealed? How can a man be concealed?\"\n\nOn the other hand, the hero fears not that if he withhold the avowal\nof a just and brave act it will go unwitnessed and unloved. One knows\nit,--himself,--and is pledged by it to sweetness of peace and to\nnobleness of aim which will prove in the end a better proclamation of it\nthan the relating of the incident. Virtue is the adherence in action to\nthe nature of things, and the nature of things makes it prevalent. It\nconsists in a perpetual substitution of being for seeming, and with\nsublime propriety God is described as saying, I AM.\n\nThe lesson which these observations convey is, Be, and not seem. Let us\nacquiesce. Let us take our bloated nothingness out of the path of the\ndivine circuits. Let us unlearn our wisdom of the world. Let us lie low\nin the Lord's power and learn that truth alone makes rich and great.\n\nIf you visit your friend, why need you apologize for not having visited\nhim, and waste his time and deface your own act? Visit him now. Let\nhim feel that the highest love has come to see him, in thee its\nlowest organ. Or why need you torment yourself and friend by secret\nself-reproaches that you have not assisted him or complimented him with\ngifts and salutations heretofore? Be a gift and a benediction. Shine\nwith real light and not with the borrowed reflection of gifts. Common\nmen are apologies for men; they bow the head, excuse themselves with\nprolix reasons, and accumulate appearances because the substance is not.\n\nWe are full of these superstitions of sense, the worship of magnitude.\nWe call the poet inactive, because he is not a president, a merchant, or\na porter. We adore an institution, and do not see that it is founded\non a thought which we have. But real action is in silent moments. The\nepochs of our life are not in the visible facts of our choice of a\ncalling, our marriage, our acquisition of an office, and the like,\nbut in a silent thought by the way-side as we walk; in a thought which\nrevises our entire manner of life and says,--'Thus hast thou done, but\nit were better thus.' And all our after years, like menials, serve and\nwait on this, and according to their ability execute its will. This\nrevisal or correction is a constant force, which, as a tendency, reaches\nthrough our lifetime. The object of the man, the aim of these moments,\nis to make daylight shine through him, to suffer the law to traverse\nhis whole being without obstruction, so that on what point soever of his\ndoing your eye falls it shall report truly of his character, whether it\nbe his diet, his house, his religious forms, his society, his mirth, his\nvote, his opposition. Now he is not homogeneous, but heterogeneous, and\nthe ray does not traverse; there are no thorough lights, but the eye of\nthe beholder is puzzled, detecting many unlike tendencies and a life not\nyet at one.\n\nWhy should we make it a point with our false modesty to disparage\nthat man we are and that form of being assigned to us? A good man\nis contented. I love and honor Epaminondas, but I do not wish to be\nEpaminondas. I hold it more just to love the world of this hour than\nthe world of his hour. Nor can you, if I am true, excite me to the least\nuneasiness by saying, 'He acted and thou sittest still.' I see action\nto be good, when the need is, and sitting still to be also good.\nEpaminondas, if he was the man I take him for, would have sat still with\njoy and peace, if his lot had been mine. Heaven is large, and affords\nspace for all modes of love and fortitude. Why should we be busybodies\nand superserviceable? Action and inaction are alike to the true. One\npiece of the tree is cut for a weathercock and one for the sleeper of a\nbridge; the virtue of the wood is apparent in both.\n\nI desire not to disgrace the soul. The fact that I am here certainly\nshows me that the soul had need of an organ here. Shall I not assume the\npost? Shall I skulk and dodge and duck with my unseasonable apologies\nand vain modesty and imagine my being here impertinent? less pertinent\nthan Epaminondas or Homer being there? and that the soul did not know\nits own needs? Besides, without any reasoning on the matter, I have\nno discontent. The good soul nourishes me and unlocks new magazines\nof power and enjoyment to me every day. I will not meanly decline the\nimmensity of good, because I have heard that it has come to others in\nanother shape.\n\nBesides, why should we be cowed by the name of Action? 'Tis a trick of\nthe senses,--no more. We know that the ancestor of every action is a\nthought. The poor mind does not seem to itself to be any thing unless it\nhave an outside badge,--some Gentoo diet, or Quaker coat, or Calvinistic\nprayer-meeting, or philanthropic society, or a great donation, or a high\noffice, or, any how, some wild contrasting action to testify that it is\nsomewhat. The rich mind lies in the sun and sleeps, and is Nature. To\nthink is to act.\n\nLet us, if we must have great actions, make our own so. All action is of\nan infinite elasticity, and the least admits of being inflated with the\ncelestial air until it eclipses the sun and moon. Let us seek one peace\nby fidelity. Let me heed my duties. Why need I go gadding into the\nscenes and philosophy of Greek and Italian history before I have\njustified myself to my benefactors? How dare I read Washington's\ncampaigns when I have not answered the letters of my own correspondents?\nIs not that a just objection to much of our reading? It is a\npusillanimous desertion of our work to gaze after our neighbors. It is\npeeping. Byron says of Jack Bunting,--\n\n     \"He knew not what to say, and so he swore.\"\n\nI may say it of our preposterous use of books,--He knew not what to do,\nand so he read. I can think of nothing to fill my time with, and I find\nthe Life of Brant. It is a very extravagant compliment to pay to Brant,\nor to General Schuyler, or to General Washington. My time should be as\ngood as their time,--my facts, my net of relations, as good as theirs,\nor either of theirs. Rather let me do my work so well that other idlers\nif they choose may compare my texture with the texture of these and find\nit identical with the best.\n\nThis over-estimate of the possibilities of Paul and Pericles, this\nunder-estimate of our own, comes from a neglect of the fact of an\nidentical nature. Bonaparte knew but one merit, and rewarded in one and\nthe same way the good soldier, the good astronomer, the good poet,\nthe good player. The poet uses the names of Caesar, of Tamerlane, of\nBonduca, of Belisarius; the painter uses the conventional story of\nthe Virgin Mary, of Paul, of Peter. He does not therefore defer to the\nnature of these accidental men, of these stock heroes. If the poet write\na true drama, then he is Caesar, and not the player of Caesar; then the\nselfsame strain of thought, emotion as pure, wit as subtle, motions\nas swift, mounting, extravagant, and a heart as great, self-sufficing,\ndauntless, which on the waves of its love and hope can uplift all that\nis reckoned solid and precious in the world,--palaces, gardens, money,\nnavies, kingdoms,--marking its own incomparable worth by the slight it\ncasts on these gauds of men;--these all are his, and by the power of\nthese he rouses the nations. Let a man believe in God, and not in names\nand places and persons. Let the great soul incarnated in some woman's\nform, poor and sad and single, in some Dolly or Joan, go out to service,\nand sweep chambers and scour floors, and its effulgent daybeams cannot\nbe muffled or hid, but to sweep and scour will instantly appear supreme\nand beautiful actions, the top and radiance of human life, and all\npeople will get mops and brooms; until, lo! suddenly the great soul has\nenshrined itself in some other form and done some other deed, and that\nis now the flower and head of all living nature.\n\nWe are the photometers, we the irritable goldleaf and tinfoil that\nmeasure the accumulations of the subtle element. We know the authentic\neffects of the true fire through every one of its million disguises.\n\n*****\n\n\n\n     LOVE.\n\n     \"I was as a gem concealed;\n     Me my burning ray revealed.\"\n                            Koran.\n\n\n\n\nV. LOVE.\n\nEvery promise of the soul has innumerable fulfilments; each of its joys\nripens into a new want. Nature, uncontainable, flowing, forelooking, in\nthe first sentiment of kindness anticipates already a benevolence which\nshall lose all particular regards in its general light. The introduction\nto this felicity is in a private and tender relation of one to one,\nwhich is the enchantment of human life; which, like a certain divine\nrage and enthusiasm, seizes on man at one period and works a revolution\nin his mind and body; unites him to his race, pledges him to the\ndomestic and civic relations, carries him with new sympathy into nature,\nenhances the power of the senses, opens the imagination, adds to his\ncharacter heroic and sacred attributes, establishes marriage, and gives\npermanence to human society.\n\nThe natural association of the sentiment of love with the heyday of the\nblood seems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints,\nwhich every youth and maid should confess to be true to their throbbing\nexperience, one must not be too old. The delicious fancies of youth\nreject the least savor of a mature philosophy, as chilling with age and\npedantry their purple bloom. And therefore I know I incur the imputation\nof unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those who compose the Court\nand Parliament of Love. But from these formidable censors I shall appeal\nto my seniors. For it is to be considered that this passion of which\nwe speak, though it begin with the young, yet forsakes not the old, or\nrather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow old, but makes\nthe aged participators of it not less than the tender maiden, though in\na different and nobler sort. For it is a fire that kindling its first\nembers in the narrow nook of a private bosom, caught from a wandering\nspark out of another private heart, glows and enlarges until it warms\nand beams upon multitudes of men and women, upon the universal heart of\nall, and so lights up the whole world and all nature with its generous\nflames. It matters not therefore whether we attempt to describe the\npassion at twenty, at thirty, or at eighty years. He who paints it at\nthe first period will lose some of its later, he who paints it at\nthe last, some of its earlier traits. Only it is to be hoped that by\npatience and the Muses' aid we may attain to that inward view of the law\nwhich shall describe a truth ever young and beautiful, so central that\nit shall commend itself to the eye, at whatever angle beholden.\n\nAnd the first condition is, that we must leave a too close and lingering\nadherence to facts, and study the sentiment as it appeared in hope and\nnot in history. For each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured,\nas the life of man is not, to his imagination. Each man sees over his\nown experience a certain stain of error, whilst that of other men looks\nfair and ideal. Let any man go back to those delicious relations which\nmake the beauty of his life, which have given him sincerest instruction\nand nourishment, he will shrink and moan. Alas! I know not why, but\ninfinite compunctions embitter in mature life the remembrances of\nbudding joy and cover every beloved name. Every thing is beautiful seen\nfrom the point of the intellect, or as truth. But all is sour, if seen\nas experience. Details are melancholy; the plan is seemly and noble. In\nthe actual world--the painful kingdom of time and place--dwell care, and\ncanker, and fear. With thought, with the ideal, is immortal hilarity,\nthe rose of joy. Round it all the Muses sing. But grief cleaves to\nnames, and persons, and the partial interests of to-day and yesterday.\n\nThe strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic\nof personal relations usurps in the conversation of society. What do\nwe wish to know of any worthy person so much, as how he has sped in\nthe history of this sentiment? What books in the circulating libraries\ncirculate? How we glow over these novels of passion, when the story is\ntold with any spark of truth and nature! And what fastens attention, in\nthe intercourse of life, like any passage betraying affection between\ntwo parties? Perhaps we never saw them before, and never shall meet them\nagain. But we see them exchange a glance, or betray a deep emotion, and\nwe are no longer strangers. We understand them, and take the warmest\ninterest in the development of the romance. All mankind love a lover.\nThe earliest demonstrations of complacency and kindness are nature's\nmost winning pictures. It is the dawn of civility and grace in the\ncoarse and rustic. The rude village boy teases the girls about the\nschool-house door;--but to-day he comes running into the entry, and\nmeets one fair child disposing her satchel; he holds her books to help\nher, and instantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him\ninfinitely, and was a sacred precinct. Among the throng of girls he\nruns rudely enough, but one alone distances him; and these two little\nneighbors, that were so close just now, have learned to respect each\nother's personality. Or who can avert his eyes from the engaging,\nhalf-artful, half-artless ways of school-girls who go into the country\nshops to buy a skein of silk or a sheet of paper, and talk half an\nhour about nothing with the broad-faced, good-natured shop-boy. In the\nvillage they are on a perfect equality, which love delights in, and\nwithout any coquetry the happy, affectionate nature of woman flows out\nin this pretty gossip. The girls may have little beauty, yet plainly\ndo they establish between them and the good boy the most agreeable,\nconfiding relations, what with their fun and their earnest, about Edgar\nand Jonas and Almira, and who was invited to the party, and who danced\nat the dancing-school, and when the singing-school would begin, and\nother nothings concerning which the parties cooed. By and by that boy\nwants a wife, and very truly and heartily will he know where to find\na sincere and sweet mate, without any risk such as Milton deplores as\nincident to scholars and great men.\n\nI have been told that in some public discourses of mine my reverence for\nthe intellect has made me unjustly cold to the personal relations. But\nnow I almost shrink at the remembrance of such disparaging words. For\npersons are love's world, and the coldest philosopher cannot recount the\ndebt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the power of\nlove, without being tempted to unsay, as treasonable to nature, aught\nderogatory to the social instincts. For though the celestial rapture\nfalling out of heaven seizes only upon those of tender age, and although\na beauty overpowering all analysis or comparison and putting us\nquite beside ourselves we can seldom see after thirty years, yet the\nremembrance of these visions outlasts all other remembrances, and is a\nwreath of flowers on the oldest brows. But here is a strange fact; it\nmay seem to many men, in revising their experience, that they have\nno fairer page in their life's book than the delicious memory of some\npassages wherein affection contrived to give a witchcraft, surpassing\nthe deep attraction of its own truth, to a parcel of accidental and\ntrivial circumstances. In looking backward they may find that several\nthings which were not the charm have more reality to this groping memory\nthan the charm itself which embalmed them. But be our experience in\nparticulars what it may, no man ever forgot the visitations of that\npower to his heart and brain, which created all things anew; which was\nthe dawn in him of music, poetry, and art; which made the face of\nnature radiant with purple light, the morning and the night varied\nenchantments; when a single tone of one voice could make the heart\nbound, and the most trivial circumstance associated with one form is put\nin the amber of memory; when he became all eye when one was present,\nand all memory when one was gone; when the youth becomes a watcher of\nwindows and studious of a glove, a veil, a ribbon, or the wheels of a\ncarriage; when no place is too solitary and none too silent, for him who\nhas richer company and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts than any\nold friends, though best and purest, can give him; for the figures,\nthe motions, the words of the beloved object are not like other images\nwritten in water, but, as Plutarch said, \"enamelled in fire,\" and make\nthe study of midnight:--\n\n     \"Thou art not gone being gone, where'er thou art,\n      Thou leav'st in him thy watchful eyes, in him thy\n        loving heart.\"\n\nIn the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at the recollection\nof days when happiness was not happy enough, but must be drugged with\nthe relish of pain and fear; for he touched the secret of the matter who\nsaid of love,--\n\n     \"All other pleasures are not worth its pains:\"\n\nand when the day was not long enough, but the night too must be consumed\nin keen recollections; when the head boiled all night on the pillow\nwith the generous deed it resolved on; when the moonlight was a pleasing\nfever and the stars were letters and the flowers ciphers and the air was\ncoined into song; when all business seemed an impertinence, and all the\nmen and women running to and fro in the streets, mere pictures.\n\nThe passion rebuilds the world for the youth. It makes all things alive\nand significant. Nature grows conscious. Every bird on the boughs of the\ntree sings now to his heart and soul. The notes are almost articulate.\nThe clouds have faces as he looks on them. The trees of the forest,\nthe waving grass and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent; and he\nalmost fears to trust them with the secret which they seem to invite.\nYet nature soothes and sympathizes. In the green solitude he finds a\ndearer home than with men:--\n\n          \"Fountain-heads and pathless groves,\n           Places which pale passion loves,\n           Moonlight walks, when all the fowls\n           Are safely housed, save bats and owls,\n           A midnight bell, a passing groan,--\n           These are the sounds we feed upon.\"\n\nBehold there in the wood the fine madman! He is a palace of sweet sounds\nand sights; he dilates; he is twice a man; he walks with arms akimbo; he\nsoliloquizes; he accosts the grass and the trees; he feels the blood of\nthe violet, the clover and the lily in his veins; and he talks with the\nbrook that wets his foot.\n\nThe heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made\nhim love music and verse. It is a fact often observed, that men have\nwritten good verses under the inspiration of passion, who cannot write\nwell under any other circumstances.\n\nThe like force has the passion over all his nature. It expands the\nsentiment; it makes the clown gentle and gives the coward heart. Into\nthe most pitiful and abject it will infuse a heart and courage to defy\nthe world, so only it have the countenance of the beloved object. In\ngiving him to another it still more gives him to himself. He is a new\nman, with new perceptions, new and keener purposes, and a religious\nsolemnity of character and aims. He does not longer appertain to his\nfamily and society; he is somewhat; he is a person; he is a soul.\n\nAnd here let us examine a little nearer the nature of that influence\nwhich is thus potent over the human youth. Beauty, whose revelation to\nman we now celebrate, welcome as the sun wherever it pleases to shine,\nwhich pleases everybody with it and with themselves, seems sufficient\nto itself. The lover cannot paint his maiden to his fancy poor and\nsolitary. Like a tree in flower, so much soft, budding, informing\nloveliness is society for itself; and she teaches his eye why Beauty was\npictured with Loves and Graces attending her steps. Her existence makes\nthe world rich. Though she extrudes all other persons from his attention\nas cheap and unworthy, she indemnifies him by carrying out her own being\ninto somewhat impersonal, large, mundane, so that the maiden stands\nto him for a representative of all select things and virtues. For that\nreason the lover never sees personal resemblances in his mistress to her\nkindred or to others. His friends find in her a likeness to her mother,\nor her sisters, or to persons not of her blood. The lover sees no\nresemblance except to summer evenings and diamond mornings, to rainbows\nand the song of birds.\n\nThe ancients called beauty the flowering of virtue. Who can analyze the\nnameless charm which glances from one and another face and form? We are\ntouched with emotions of tenderness and complacency, but we cannot\nfind whereat this dainty emotion, this wandering gleam, points. It\nis destroyed for the imagination by any attempt to refer it to\norganization. Nor does it point to any relations of friendship or love\nknown and described in society, but, as it seems to me, to a quite\nother and unattainable sphere, to relations of transcendent delicacy\nand sweetness, to what roses and violets hint and foreshow. We cannot\napproach beauty. Its nature is like opaline doves'-neck lustres,\nhovering and evanescent. Herein it resembles the most excellent\nthings, which all have this rainbow character, defying all attempts at\nappropriation and use. What else did Jean Paul Richter signify, when he\nsaid to music, \"Away! away! thou speakest to me of things which in all\nmy endless life I have not found, and shall not find.\" The same fluency\nmay be observed in every work of the plastic arts. The statue is then\nbeautiful when it begins to be incomprehensible, when it is passing out\nof criticism and can no longer be defined by compass and measuring-wand,\nbut demands an active imagination to go with it and to say what it is in\nthe act of doing. The god or hero of the sculptor is always represented\nin a transition from that which is representable to the senses, to that\nwhich is not. Then first it ceases to be a stone. The same remark holds\nof painting. And of poetry the success is not attained when it lulls and\nsatisfies, but when it astonishes and fires us with new endeavors after\nthe unattainable. Concerning it Landor inquires \"whether it is not to be\nreferred to some purer state of sensation and existence.\"\n\nIn like manner, personal beauty is then first charming and itself when\nit dissatisfies us with any end; when it becomes a story without an end;\nwhen it suggests gleams and visions and not earthly satisfactions; when\nit makes the beholder feel his unworthiness; when he cannot feel his\nright to it, though he were Caesar; he cannot feel more right to it than\nto the firmament and the splendors of a sunset.\n\nHence arose the saying, \"If I love you, what is that to you?\" We say so\nbecause we feel that what we love is not in your will, but above it. It\nis not you, but your radiance. It is that which you know not in yourself\nand can never know.\n\nThis agrees well with that high philosophy of Beauty which the ancient\nwriters delighted in; for they said that the soul of man, embodied here\non earth, went roaming up and down in quest of that other world of its\nown out of which it came into this, but was soon stupefied by the light\nof the natural sun, and unable to see any other objects than those of\nthis world, which are but shadows of real things. Therefore the Deity\nsends the glory of youth before the soul, that it may avail itself of\nbeautiful bodies as aids to its recollection of the celestial good and\nfair; and the man beholding such a person in the female sex runs to\nher and finds the highest joy in contemplating the form, movement, and\nintelligence of this person, because it suggests to him the presence of\nthat which indeed is within the beauty, and the cause of the beauty.\n\nIf however, from too much conversing with material objects, the soul was\ngross, and misplaced its satisfaction in the body, it reaped nothing but\nsorrow; body being unable to fulfil the promise which beauty holds out;\nbut if, accepting the hint of these visions and suggestions which beauty\nmakes to his mind, the soul passes through the body and falls to admire\nstrokes of character, and the lovers contemplate one another in their\ndiscourses and their actions, then they pass to the true palace of\nbeauty, more and more inflame their love of it, and by this love\nextinguishing the base affection, as the sun puts out the fire by\nshining on the hearth, they become pure and hallowed. By conversation\nwith that which is in itself excellent, magnanimous, lowly, and just,\nthe lover comes to a warmer love of these nobilities, and a quicker\napprehension of them. Then he passes from loving them in one to loving\nthem in all, and so is the one beautiful soul only the door through\nwhich he enters to the society of all true and pure souls. In the\nparticular society of his mate he attains a clearer sight of any spot,\nany taint which her beauty has contracted from this world, and is\nable to point it out, and this with mutual joy that they are now able,\nwithout offence, to indicate blemishes and hindrances in each other, and\ngive to each all help and comfort in curing the same. And beholding in\nmany souls the traits of the divine beauty, and separating in each\nsoul that which is divine from the taint which it has contracted in\nthe world, the lover ascends to the highest beauty, to the love and\nknowledge of the Divinity, by steps on this ladder of created souls.\n\nSomewhat like this have the truly wise told us of love in all ages.\nThe doctrine is not old, nor is it new. If Plato, Plutarch and Apuleius\ntaught it, so have Petrarch, Angelo and Milton. It awaits a truer\nunfolding in opposition and rebuke to that subterranean prudence which\npresides at marriages with words that take hold of the upper world,\nwhilst one eye is prowling in the cellar; so that its gravest discourse\nhas a savor of hams and powdering-tubs. Worst, when this sensualism\nintrudes into the education of young women, and withers the hope and\naffection of human nature by teaching that marriage signifies nothing\nbut a housewife's thrift, and that woman's life has no other aim.\n\nBut this dream of love, though beautiful, is only one scene in our\nplay. In the procession of the soul from within outward, it enlarges\nits circles ever, like the pebble thrown into the pond, or the light\nproceeding from an orb. The rays of the soul alight first on things\nnearest, on every utensil and toy, on nurses and domestics, on the house\nand yard and passengers, on the circle of household acquaintance,\non politics and geography and history. But things are ever grouping\nthemselves according to higher or more interior laws. Neighborhood,\nsize, numbers, habits, persons, lose by degrees their power over us.\nCause and effect, real affinities, the longing for harmony between\nthe soul and the circumstance, the progressive, idealizing instinct,\npredominate later, and the step backward from the higher to the lower\nrelations is impossible. Thus even love, which is the deification of\npersons, must become more impersonal every day. Of this at first it\ngives no hint. Little think the youth and maiden who are glancing\nat each other across crowded rooms with eyes so full of mutual\nintelligence, of the precious fruit long hereafter to proceed from this\nnew, quite external stimulus. The work of vegetation begins first in the\nirritability of the bark and leaf-buds. From exchanging glances, they\nadvance to acts of courtesy, of gallantry, then to fiery passion, to\nplighting troth and marriage. Passion beholds its object as a perfect\nunit. The soul is wholly embodied, and the body is wholly ensouled:--\n\n          \"Her pure and eloquent blood\n           Spoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought,\n           That one might almost say her body thought.\"\n\nRomeo, if dead, should be cut up into little stars to make the heavens\nfine. Life, with this pair, has no other aim, asks no more, than\nJuliet,--than Romeo. Night, day, studies, talents, kingdoms, religion,\nare all contained in this form full of soul, in this soul which is\nall form. The lovers delight in endearments, in avowals of love, in\ncomparisons of their regards. When alone, they solace themselves with\nthe remembered image of the other. Does that other see the same star,\nthe same melting cloud, read the same book, feel the same emotion, that\nnow delight me? They try and weigh their affection, and adding up costly\nadvantages, friends, opportunities, properties, exult in discovering\nthat willingly, joyfully, they would give all as a ransom for the\nbeautiful, the beloved head, not one hair of which shall be harmed.\nBut the lot of humanity is on these children. Danger, sorrow, and pain\narrive to them, as to all. Love prays. It makes covenants with Eternal\nPower in behalf of this dear mate. The union which is thus effected and\nwhich adds a new value to every atom in nature--for it transmutes every\nthread throughout the whole web of relation into a golden ray, and\nbathes the soul in a new and sweeter element--is yet a temporary state.\nNot always can flowers, pearls, poetry, protestations, nor even home in\nanother heart, content the awful soul that dwells in clay. It arouses\nitself at last from these endearments, as toys, and puts on the harness\nand aspires to vast and universal aims. The soul which is in the soul\nof each, craving a perfect beatitude, detects incongruities, defects\nand disproportion in the behavior of the other. Hence arise surprise,\nexpostulation and pain. Yet that which drew them to each other was signs\nof loveliness, signs of virtue; and these virtues are there, however\neclipsed. They appear and reappear and continue to attract; but the\nregard changes, quits the sign and attaches to the substance. This\nrepairs the wounded affection. Meantime, as life wears on, it proves\na game of permutation and combination of all possible positions of the\nparties, to employ all the resources of each and acquaint each with the\nstrength and weakness of the other. For it is the nature and end of this\nrelation, that they should represent the human race to each other.\nAll that is in the world, which is or ought to be known, is cunningly\nwrought into the texture of man, of woman:--\n\n          \"The person love does to us fit,\n           Like manna, has the taste of all in it.\"\n\nThe world rolls; the circumstances vary every hour. The angels that\ninhabit this temple of the body appear at the windows, and the gnomes\nand vices also. By all the virtues they are united. If there be virtue,\nall the vices are known as such; they confess and flee. Their once\nflaming regard is sobered by time in either breast, and losing\nin violence what it gains in extent, it becomes a thorough good\nunderstanding. They resign each other without complaint to the good\noffices which man and woman are severally appointed to discharge in\ntime, and exchange the passion which once could not lose sight of its\nobject, for a cheerful, disengaged furtherance, whether present or\nabsent, of each other's designs. At last they discover that all which at\nfirst drew them together,--those once sacred features, that magical play\nof charms,--was deciduous, had a prospective end, like the scaffolding\nby which the house was built; and the purification of the intellect and\nthe heart from year to year is the real marriage, foreseen and prepared\nfrom the first, and wholly above their consciousness. Looking at\nthese aims with which two persons, a man and a woman, so variously and\ncorrelatively gifted, are shut up in one house to spend in the nuptial\nsociety forty or fifty years, I do not wonder at the emphasis with which\nthe heart prophesies this crisis from early infancy, at the profuse\nbeauty with which the instincts deck the nuptial bower, and nature and\nintellect and art emulate each other in the gifts and the melody they\nbring to the epithalamium.\n\nThus are we put in training for a love which knows not sex, nor person,\nnor partiality, but which seeks virtue and wisdom everywhere, to the end\nof increasing virtue and wisdom. We are by nature observers, and thereby\nlearners. That is our permanent state. But we are often made to feel\nthat our affections are but tents of a night. Though slowly and with\npain, the objects of the affections change, as the objects of thought\ndo. There are moments when the affections rule and absorb the man and\nmake his happiness dependent on a person or persons. But in health\nthe mind is presently seen again,--its overarching vault, bright with\ngalaxies of immutable lights, and the warm loves and fears that swept\nover us as clouds must lose their finite character and blend with God,\nto attain their own perfection. But we need not fear that we can lose\nany thing by the progress of the soul. The soul may be trusted to the\nend. That which is so beautiful and attractive as these relations, must\nbe succeeded and supplanted only by what is more beautiful, and so on\nfor ever.\n\n*****\n\n\n\n     FRIENDSHIP.\n\n     A RUDDY drop of manly blood\n     The surging sea outweighs;\n     The world uncertain comes and goes,\n     The lover rooted stays.\n     I fancied he was fled,\n     And, after many a year,\n     Glowed unexhausted kindliness\n     Like daily sunrise there.\n     My careful heart was free again,--\n     O friend, my bosom said,\n     Through thee alone the sky is arched,\n     Through thee the rose is red,\n     All things through thee take nobler form\n     And look beyond the earth,\n     The mill-round of our fate appears\n     A sun-path in thy worth.\n     Me too thy nobleness has taught\n     To master my despair;\n     The fountains of my hidden life\n     Are through thy friendship fair.\n\n\n\n\nVI. FRIENDSHIP.\n\nWe have a great deal more kindness than is ever spoken. Maugre all\nthe selfishness that chills like east winds the world, the whole human\nfamily is bathed with an element of love like a fine ether. How many\npersons we meet in houses, whom we scarcely speak to, whom yet we honor,\nand who honor us! How many we see in the street, or sit with in church,\nwhom, though silently, we warmly rejoice to be with! Read the language\nof these wandering eye-beams. The heart knoweth.\n\nThe effect of the indulgence of this human affection is a certain\ncordial exhilaration. In poetry and in common speech, the emotions of\nbenevolence and complacency which are felt towards others are likened to\nthe material effects of fire; so swift, or much more swift, more active,\nmore cheering, are these fine inward irradiations. From the highest\ndegree of passionate love to the lowest degree of good-will, they make\nthe sweetness of life.\n\nOur intellectual and active powers increase with our affection. The\nscholar sits down to write, and all his years of meditation do not\nfurnish him with one good thought or happy expression; but it is\nnecessary to write a letter to a friend,--and forthwith troops of gentle\nthoughts invest themselves, on every hand, with chosen words. See, in\nany house where virtue and self-respect abide, the palpitation which\nthe approach of a stranger causes. A commended stranger is expected and\nannounced, and an uneasiness betwixt pleasure and pain invades all the\nhearts of a household. His arrival almost brings fear to the good hearts\nthat would welcome him. The house is dusted, all things fly into their\nplaces, the old coat is exchanged for the new, and they must get up a\ndinner if they can. Of a commended stranger, only the good report is\ntold by others, only the good and new is heard by us. He stands to us\nfor humanity. He is what we wish. Having imagined and invested him, we\nask how we should stand related in conversation and action with such a\nman, and are uneasy with fear. The same idea exalts conversation with\nhim. We talk better than we are wont. We have the nimblest fancy, a\nricher memory, and our dumb devil has taken leave for the time. For\nlong hours we can continue a series of sincere, graceful, rich\ncommunications, drawn from the oldest, secretest experience, so that\nthey who sit by, of our own kinsfolk and acquaintance, shall feel a\nlively surprise at our unusual powers. But as soon as the stranger\nbegins to intrude his partialities, his definitions, his defects, into\nthe conversation, it is all over. He has heard the first, the last\nand best he will ever hear from us. He is no stranger now. Vulgarity,\nignorance, misapprehension are old acquaintances. Now, when he comes, he\nmay get the order, the dress and the dinner,--but the throbbing of the\nheart and the communications of the soul, no more.\n\nWhat is so pleasant as these jets of affection which make a young world\nfor me again? What so delicious as a just and firm encounter of two,\nin a thought, in a feeling? How beautiful, on their approach to this\nbeating heart, the steps and forms of the gifted and the true! The\nmoment we indulge our affections, the earth is metamorphosed; there is\nno winter and no night; all tragedies, all ennuis vanish,--all duties\neven; nothing fills the proceeding eternity but the forms all radiant of\nbeloved persons. Let the soul be assured that somewhere in the universe\nit should rejoin its friend, and it would be content and cheerful alone\nfor a thousand years.\n\nI awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends, the old\nand the new. Shall I not call God the Beautiful, who daily showeth\nhimself so to me in his gifts? I chide society, I embrace solitude, and\nyet I am not so ungrateful as not to see the wise, the lovely and the\nnoble-minded, as from time to time they pass my gate. Who hears me, who\nunderstands me, becomes mine,--a possession for all time. Nor is Nature\nso poor but she gives me this joy several times, and thus we weave\nsocial threads of our own, a new web of relations; and, as many thoughts\nin succession substantiate themselves, we shall by and by stand in a\nnew world of our own creation, and no longer strangers and pilgrims in\na traditionary globe. My friends have come to me unsought. The great God\ngave them to me. By oldest right, by the divine affinity of virtue with\nitself, I find them, or rather not I but the Deity in me and in them\nderides and cancels the thick walls of individual character, relation,\nage, sex, circumstance, at which he usually connives, and now makes many\none. High thanks I owe you, excellent lovers, who carry out the world\nfor me to new and noble depths, and enlarge the meaning of all my\nthoughts. These are new poetry of the first Bard,--poetry without\nstop,--hymn, ode and epic, poetry still flowing, Apollo and the Muses\nchanting still. Will these too separate themselves from me again, or\nsome of them? I know not, but I fear it not; for my relation to them\nis so pure, that we hold by simple affinity, and the Genius of my life\nbeing thus social, the same affinity will exert its energy on whomsoever\nis as noble as these men and women, wherever I may be.\n\nI confess to an extreme tenderness of nature on this point. It is almost\ndangerous to me to \"crush the sweet poison of misused wine\" of the\naffections. A new person is to me a great event and hinders me from\nsleep. I have often had fine fancies about persons which have given\nme delicious hours; but the joy ends in the day; it yields no fruit.\nThought is not born of it; my action is very little modified. I must\nfeel pride in my friend's accomplishments as if they were mine, and a\nproperty in his virtues. I feel as warmly when he is praised, as the\nlover when he hears applause of his engaged maiden. We over-estimate the\nconscience of our friend. His goodness seems better than our goodness,\nhis nature finer, his temptations less. Every thing that is his,--his\nname, his form, his dress, books and instruments,--fancy enhances. Our\nown thought sounds new and larger from his mouth.\n\nYet the systole and diastole of the heart are not without their analogy\nin the ebb and flow of love. Friendship, like the immortality of the\nsoul, is too good to be believed. The lover, beholding his maiden, half\nknows that she is not verily that which he worships; and in the golden\nhour of friendship we are surprised with shades of suspicion and\nunbelief. We doubt that we bestow on our hero the virtues in which he\nshines, and afterwards worship the form to which we have ascribed this\ndivine inhabitation. In strictness, the soul does not respect men as\nit respects itself. In strict science all persons underlie the same\ncondition of an infinite remoteness. Shall we fear to cool our love by\nmining for the metaphysical foundation of this Elysian temple? Shall I\nnot be as real as the things I see? If I am, I shall not fear to know\nthem for what they are. Their essence is not less beautiful than their\nappearance, though it needs finer organs for its apprehension. The\nroot of the plant is not unsightly to science, though for chaplets and\nfestoons we cut the stem short. And I must hazard the production of\nthe bald fact amidst these pleasing reveries, though it should prove an\nEgyptian skull at our banquet. A man who stands united with his thought\nconceives magnificently of himself. He is conscious of a universal\nsuccess, even though bought by uniform particular failures. No\nadvantages, no powers, no gold or force, can be any match for him. I\ncannot choose but rely on my own poverty more than on your wealth.\nI cannot make your consciousness tantamount to mine. Only the star\ndazzles; the planet has a faint, moon-like ray. I hear what you say of\nthe admirable parts and tried temper of the party you praise, but I see\nwell that for all his purple cloaks I shall not like him, unless he is\nat last a poor Greek like me. I cannot deny it, O friend, that the vast\nshadow of the Phenomenal includes thee also in its pied and painted\nimmensity,--thee also, compared with whom all else is shadow. Thou art\nnot Being, as Truth is, as Justice is,--thou art not my soul, but a\npicture and effigy of that. Thou hast come to me lately, and already\nthou art seizing thy hat and cloak. Is it not that the soul puts forth\nfriends as the tree puts forth leaves, and presently, by the germination\nof new buds, extrudes the old leaf? The law of nature is alternation\nfor evermore. Each electrical state superinduces the opposite. The\nsoul environs itself with friends that it may enter into a grander\nself-acquaintance or solitude; and it goes alone for a season, that it\nmay exalt its conversation or society. This method betrays itself along\nthe whole history of our personal relations. The instinct of affection\nrevives the hope of union with our mates, and the returning sense of\ninsulation recalls us from the chase. Thus every man passes his life in\nthe search after friendship, and if he should record his true sentiment,\nhe might write a letter like this to each new candidate for his love:--\n\nDEAR FRIEND,\n\nIf I was sure of thee, sure of thy capacity, sure to match my mood with\nthine, I should never think again of trifles in relation to thy comings\nand goings. I am not very wise; my moods are quite attainable, and\nI respect thy genius; it is to me as yet unfathomed; yet dare I not\npresume in thee a perfect intelligence of me, and so thou art to me a\ndelicious torment. Thine ever, or never.\n\nYet these uneasy pleasures and fine pains are for curiosity and not\nfor life. They are not to be indulged. This is to weave cobweb, and not\ncloth. Our friendships hurry to short and poor conclusions, because we\nhave made them a texture of wine and dreams, instead of the tough fibre\nof the human heart. The laws of friendship are austere and eternal, of\none web with the laws of nature and of morals. But we have aimed at a\nswift and petty benefit, to suck a sudden sweetness. We snatch at the\nslowest fruit in the whole garden of God, which many summers and\nmany winters must ripen. We seek our friend not sacredly, but with an\nadulterate passion which would appropriate him to ourselves. In vain. We\nare armed all over with subtle antagonisms, which, as soon as we meet,\nbegin to play, and translate all poetry into stale prose. Almost all\npeople descend to meet. All association must be a compromise, and,\nwhat is worst, the very flower and aroma of the flower of each of\nthe beautiful natures disappears as they approach each other. What a\nperpetual disappointment is actual society, even of the virtuous and\ngifted! After interviews have been compassed with long foresight we\nmust be tormented presently by baffled blows, by sudden, unseasonable\napathies, by epilepsies of wit and of animal spirits, in the heyday\nof friendship and thought. Our faculties do not play us true, and both\nparties are relieved by solitude.\n\nI ought to be equal to every relation. It makes no difference how many\nfriends I have and what content I can find in conversing with each, if\nthere be one to whom I am not equal. If I have shrunk unequal from one\ncontest, the joy I find in all the rest becomes mean and cowardly. I\nshould hate myself, if then I made my other friends my asylum:--\n\n          \"The valiant warrior famoused for fight,\n           After a hundred victories, once foiled,\n           Is from the book of honor razed quite,\n           And all the rest forgot for which he toiled.\"\n\nOur impatience is thus sharply rebuked. Bashfulness and apathy are a\ntough husk in which a delicate organization is protected from premature\nripening. It would be lost if it knew itself before any of the\nbest souls were yet ripe enough to know and own it. Respect the\nnaturlangsamkeit which hardens the ruby in a million years, and works\nin duration in which Alps and Andes come and go as rainbows. The good\nspirit of our life has no heaven which is the price of rashness. Love,\nwhich is the essence of God, is not for levity, but for the total worth\nof man. Let us not have this childish luxury in our regards, but the\nausterest worth; let us approach our friend with an audacious trust in\nthe truth of his heart, in the breadth, impossible to be overturned, of\nhis foundations.\n\nThe attractions of this subject are not to be resisted, and I leave, for\nthe time, all account of subordinate social benefit, to speak of that\nselect and sacred relation which is a kind of absolute, and which even\nleaves the language of love suspicious and common, so much is this\npurer, and nothing is so much divine.\n\nI do not wish to treat friendships daintily, but with roughest courage.\nWhen they are real, they are not glass threads or frostwork, but the\nsolidest thing we know. For now, after so many ages of experience, what\ndo we know of nature or of ourselves? Not one step has man taken toward\nthe solution of the problem of his destiny. In one condemnation of folly\nstand the whole universe of men. But the sweet sincerity of joy and\npeace which I draw from this alliance with my brother's soul is the nut\nitself whereof all nature and all thought is but the husk and shell.\nHappy is the house that shelters a friend! It might well be built, like\na festal bower or arch, to entertain him a single day. Happier, if he\nknow the solemnity of that relation and honor its law! He who offers\nhimself a candidate for that covenant comes up, like an Olympian, to the\ngreat games where the first-born of the world are the competitors.\nHe proposes himself for contests where Time, Want, Danger, are in the\nlists, and he alone is victor who has truth enough in his constitution\nto preserve the delicacy of his beauty from the wear and tear of all\nthese. The gifts of fortune may be present or absent, but all the speed\nin that contest depends on intrinsic nobleness and the contempt\nof trifles. There are two elements that go to the composition of\nfriendship, each so sovereign that I can detect no superiority in\neither, no reason why either should be first named. One is truth. A\nfriend is a person with whom I may be sincere. Before him I may think\naloud. I am arrived at last in the presence of a man so real and\nequal that I may drop even those undermost garments of dissimulation,\ncourtesy, and second thought, which men never put off, and may deal with\nhim with the simplicity and wholeness with which one chemical atom meets\nanother. Sincerity is the luxury allowed, like diadems and authority,\nonly to the highest rank; that being permitted to speak truth, as having\nnone above it to court or conform unto. Every man alone is sincere. At\nthe entrance of a second person, hypocrisy begins. We parry and fend the\napproach of our fellow-man by compliments, by gossip, by amusements, by\naffairs. We cover up our thought from him under a hundred folds. I knew\na man who under a certain religious frenzy cast off this drapery, and\nomitting all compliment and commonplace, spoke to the conscience of\nevery person he encountered, and that with great insight and beauty. At\nfirst he was resisted, and all men agreed he was mad. But persisting--as\nindeed he could not help doing--for some time in this course, he\nattained to the advantage of bringing every man of his acquaintance into\ntrue relations with him. No man would think of speaking falsely with\nhim, or of putting him off with any chat of markets or reading-rooms.\nBut every man was constrained by so much sincerity to the like\nplaindealing, and what love of nature, what poetry, what symbol of truth\nhe had, he did certainly show him. But to most of us society shows not\nits face and eye, but its side and its back. To stand in true relations\nwith men in a false age is worth a fit of insanity, is it not? We\ncan seldom go erect. Almost every man we meet requires some\ncivility,--requires to be humored; he has some fame, some talent,\nsome whim of religion or philanthropy in his head that is not to be\nquestioned, and which spoils all conversation with him. But a friend is\na sane man who exercises not my ingenuity, but me. My friend gives me\nentertainment without requiring any stipulation on my part. A friend\ntherefore is a sort of paradox in nature. I who alone am, I who see\nnothing in nature whose existence I can affirm with equal evidence to my\nown, behold now the semblance of my being, in all its height, variety,\nand curiosity, reiterated in a foreign form; so that a friend may well\nbe reckoned the masterpiece of nature.\n\nThe other element of friendship is tenderness. We are holden to men by\nevery sort of tie, by blood, by pride, by fear, by hope, by lucre,\nby lust, by hate, by admiration, by every circumstance and badge and\ntrifle,--but we can scarce believe that so much character can subsist in\nanother as to draw us by love. Can another be so blessed and we so pure\nthat we can offer him tenderness? When a man becomes dear to me I have\ntouched the goal of fortune. I find very little written directly to the\nheart of this matter in books. And yet I have one text which I cannot\nchoose but remember. My author says,--\"I offer myself faintly and\nbluntly to those whose I effectually am, and tender myself least to him\nto whom I am the most devoted.\" I wish that friendship should have\nfeet, as well as eyes and eloquence. It must plant itself on the ground,\nbefore it vaults over the moon. I wish it to be a little of a citizen,\nbefore it is quite a cherub. We chide the citizen because he makes love\na commodity. It is an exchange of gifts, of useful loans; it is good\nneighborhood; it watches with the sick; it holds the pall at the\nfuneral; and quite loses sight of the delicacies and nobility of the\nrelation. But though we cannot find the god under this disguise of a\nsutler, yet on the other hand we cannot forgive the poet if he spins his\nthread too fine and does not substantiate his romance by the municipal\nvirtues of justice, punctuality, fidelity and pity. I hate the\nprostitution of the name of friendship to signify modish and worldly\nalliances. I much prefer the company of ploughboys and tin-peddlers to\nthe silken and perfumed amity which celebrates its days of encounter\nby a frivolous display, by rides in a curricle and dinners at the best\ntaverns. The end of friendship is a commerce the most strict and homely\nthat can be joined; more strict than any of which we have experience.\nIt is for aid and comfort through all the relations and passages of\nlife and death. It is fit for serene days and graceful gifts and country\nrambles, but also for rough roads and hard fare, shipwreck, poverty,\nand persecution. It keeps company with the sallies of the wit and the\ntrances of religion. We are to dignify to each other the daily needs and\noffices of man's life, and embellish it by courage, wisdom and unity. It\nshould never fall into something usual and settled, but should be alert\nand inventive and add rhyme and reason to what was drudgery.\n\nFriendship may be said to require natures so rare and costly, each so\nwell tempered and so happily adapted, and withal so circumstanced (for\neven in that particular, a poet says, love demands that the parties be\naltogether paired), that its satisfaction can very seldom be assured. It\ncannot subsist in its perfection, say some of those who are learned in\nthis warm lore of the heart, betwixt more than two. I am not quite\nso strict in my terms, perhaps because I have never known so high a\nfellowship as others. I please my imagination more with a circle of\ngodlike men and women variously related to each other and between\nwhom subsists a lofty intelligence. But I find this law of one to one\nperemptory for conversation, which is the practice and consummation of\nfriendship. Do not mix waters too much. The best mix as ill as good and\nbad. You shall have very useful and cheering discourse at several times\nwith two several men, but let all three of you come together and you\nshall not have one new and hearty word. Two may talk and one may hear,\nbut three cannot take part in a conversation of the most sincere and\nsearching sort. In good company there is never such discourse between\ntwo, across the table, as takes place when you leave them alone. In good\ncompany the individuals merge their egotism into a social soul exactly\nco-extensive with the several consciousnesses there present. No\npartialities of friend to friend, no fondnesses of brother to sister, of\nwife to husband, are there pertinent, but quite otherwise. Only he may\nthen speak who can sail on the common thought of the party, and not\npoorly limited to his own. Now this convention, which good sense\ndemands, destroys the high freedom of great conversation, which requires\nan absolute running of two souls into one.\n\nNo two men but being left alone with each other enter into simpler\nrelations. Yet it is affinity that determines which two shall converse.\nUnrelated men give little joy to each other, will never suspect\nthe latent powers of each. We talk sometimes of a great talent for\nconversation, as if it were a permanent property in some individuals.\nConversation is an evanescent relation,--no more. A man is reputed to\nhave thought and eloquence; he cannot, for all that, say a word to his\ncousin or his uncle. They accuse his silence with as much reason as they\nwould blame the insignificance of a dial in the shade. In the sun it\nwill mark the hour. Among those who enjoy his thought he will regain his\ntongue.\n\nFriendship requires that rare mean betwixt likeness and unlikeness\nthat piques each with the presence of power and of consent in the other\nparty. Let me be alone to the end of the world, rather than that my\nfriend should overstep, by a word or a look, his real sympathy. I am\nequally balked by antagonism and by compliance. Let him not cease an\ninstant to be himself. The only joy I have in his being mine, is that\nthe not mine is mine. I hate, where I looked for a manly furtherance, or\nat least a manly resistance, to find a mush of concession. Better be\na nettle in the side of your friend than his echo. The condition which\nhigh friendship demands is ability to do without it. That high office\nrequires great and sublime parts. There must be very two, before there\ncan be very one. Let it be an alliance of two large, formidable natures,\nmutually beheld, mutually feared, before yet they recognize the deep\nidentity which, beneath these disparities, unites them.\n\nHe only is fit for this society who is magnanimous; who is sure\nthat greatness and goodness are always economy; who is not swift to\nintermeddle with his fortunes. Let him not intermeddle with this. Leave\nto the diamond its ages to grow, nor expect to accelerate the births\nof the eternal. Friendship demands a religious treatment. We talk of\nchoosing our friends, but friends are self-elected. Reverence is a great\npart of it. Treat your friend as a spectacle. Of course he has merits\nthat are not yours, and that you cannot honor if you must needs hold\nhim close to your person. Stand aside; give those merits room; let them\nmount and expand. Are you the friend of your friend's buttons, or of\nhis thought? To a great heart he will still be a stranger in a thousand\nparticulars, that he may come near in the holiest ground. Leave it to\ngirls and boys to regard a friend as property, and to suck a short and\nall-confounding pleasure, instead of the noblest benefit.\n\nLet us buy our entrance to this guild by a long probation. Why should we\ndesecrate noble and beautiful souls by intruding on them? Why insist on\nrash personal relations with your friend? Why go to his house, or know\nhis mother and brother and sisters? Why be visited by him at your own?\nAre these things material to our covenant? Leave this touching and\nclawing. Let him be to me a spirit. A message, a thought, a sincerity,\na glance from him, I want, but not news, nor pottage. I can get politics\nand chat and neighborly conveniences from cheaper companions. Should not\nthe society of my friend be to me poetic, pure, universal and great as\nnature itself? Ought I to feel that our tie is profane in comparison\nwith yonder bar of cloud that sleeps on the horizon, or that clump of\nwaving grass that divides the brook? Let us not vilify, but raise it to\nthat standard. That great defying eye, that scornful beauty of his mien\nand action, do not pique yourself on reducing, but rather fortify and\nenhance. Worship his superiorities; wish him not less by a thought, but\nhoard and tell them all. Guard him as thy counterpart. Let him be to\nthee for ever a sort of beautiful enemy, untamable, devoutly revered,\nand not a trivial conveniency to be soon outgrown and cast aside. The\nhues of the opal, the light of the diamond, are not to be seen if the\neye is too near. To my friend I write a letter and from him I receive\na letter. That seems to you a little. It suffices me. It is a spiritual\ngift worthy of him to give and of me to receive. It profanes nobody.\nIn these warm lines the heart will trust itself, as it will not to the\ntongue, and pour out the prophecy of a godlier existence than all the\nannals of heroism have yet made good.\n\nRespect so far the holy laws of this fellowship as not to prejudice its\nperfect flower by your impatience for its opening. We must be our own\nbefore we can be another's. There is at least this satisfaction in\ncrime, according to the Latin proverb;--you can speak to your accomplice\non even terms. Crimen quos inquinat, aequat. To those whom we admire\nand love, at first we cannot. Yet the least defect of self-possession\nvitiates, in my judgment, the entire relation. There can never be deep\npeace between two spirits, never mutual respect, until in their dialogue\neach stands for the whole world.\n\nWhat is so great as friendship, let us carry with what grandeur of\nspirit we can. Let us be silent,--so we may hear the whisper of the\ngods. Let us not interfere. Who set you to cast about what you should\nsay to the select souls, or how to say any thing to such? No matter\nhow ingenious, no matter how graceful and bland. There are innumerable\ndegrees of folly and wisdom, and for you to say aught is to be\nfrivolous. Wait, and thy heart shall speak. Wait until the necessary and\neverlasting overpowers you, until day and night avail themselves of your\nlips. The only reward of virtue is virtue; the only way to have a friend\nis to be one. You shall not come nearer a man by getting into his house.\nIf unlike, his soul only flees the faster from you, and you shall never\ncatch a true glance of his eye. We see the noble afar off and they\nrepel us; why should we intrude? Late,--very late,--we perceive that\nno arrangements, no introductions, no consuetudes or habits of society\nwould be of any avail to establish us in such relations with them as we\ndesire,--but solely the uprise of nature in us to the same degree it is\nin them; then shall we meet as water with water; and if we should not\nmeet them then, we shall not want them, for we are already they. In the\nlast analysis, love is only the reflection of a man's own worthiness\nfrom other men. Men have sometimes exchanged names with their friends,\nas if they would signify that in their friend each loved his own soul.\n\nThe higher the style we demand of friendship, of course the less easy to\nestablish it with flesh and blood. We walk alone in the world. Friends\nsuch as we desire are dreams and fables. But a sublime hope cheers ever\nthe faithful heart, that elsewhere, in other regions of the universal\npower, souls are now acting, enduring, and daring, which can love us\nand which we can love. We may congratulate ourselves that the period of\nnonage, of follies, of blunders and of shame, is passed in solitude, and\nwhen we are finished men we shall grasp heroic hands in heroic hands.\nOnly be admonished by what you already see, not to strike leagues\nof friendship with cheap persons, where no friendship can be. Our\nimpatience betrays us into rash and foolish alliances which no god\nattends. By persisting in your path, though you forfeit the little you\ngain the great. You demonstrate yourself, so as to put yourself out of\nthe reach of false relations, and you draw to you the first-born of the\nworld,--those rare pilgrims whereof only one or two wander in nature\nat once, and before whom the vulgar great show as spectres and shadows\nmerely.\n\nIt is foolish to be afraid of making our ties too spiritual, as if so we\ncould lose any genuine love. Whatever correction of our popular views we\nmake from insight, nature will be sure to bear us out in, and though it\nseem to rob us of some joy, will repay us with a greater. Let us feel if\nwe will the absolute insulation of man. We are sure that we have all\nin us. We go to Europe, or we pursue persons, or we read books, in\nthe instinctive faith that these will call it out and reveal us to\nourselves. Beggars all. The persons are such as we; the Europe, an old\nfaded garment of dead persons; the books, their ghosts. Let us drop this\nidolatry. Let us give over this mendicancy. Let us even bid our dearest\nfriends farewell, and defy them, saying, 'Who are you? Unhand me: I will\nbe dependent no more.' Ah! seest thou not, O brother, that thus we part\nonly to meet again on a higher platform, and only be more each other's\nbecause we are more our own? A friend is Janus-faced; he looks to the\npast and the future. He is the child of all my foregoing hours, the\nprophet of those to come, and the harbinger of a greater friend.\n\nI do then with my friends as I do with my books. I would have them where\nI can find them, but I seldom use them. We must have society on our own\nterms, and admit or exclude it on the slightest cause. I cannot afford\nto speak much with my friend. If he is great he makes me so great that\nI cannot descend to converse. In the great days, presentiments hover\nbefore me in the firmament. I ought then to dedicate myself to them. I\ngo in that I may seize them, I go out that I may seize them. I fear only\nthat I may lose them receding into the sky in which now they are only\na patch of brighter light. Then, though I prize my friends, I cannot\nafford to talk with them and study their visions, lest I lose my own. It\nwould indeed give me a certain household joy to quit this lofty seeking,\nthis spiritual astronomy or search of stars, and come down to warm\nsympathies with you; but then I know well I shall mourn always the\nvanishing of my mighty gods. It is true, next week I shall have languid\nmoods, when I can well afford to occupy myself with foreign objects;\nthen I shall regret the lost literature of your mind, and wish you were\nby my side again. But if you come, perhaps you will fill my mind only\nwith new visions; not with yourself but with your lustres, and I shall\nnot be able any more than now to converse with you. So I will owe to my\nfriends this evanescent intercourse. I will receive from them not what\nthey have but what they are. They shall give me that which properly they\ncannot give, but which emanates from them. But they shall not hold me by\nany relations less subtile and pure. We will meet as though we met not,\nand part as though we parted not.\n\nIt has seemed to me lately more possible than I knew, to carry a\nfriendship greatly, on one side, without due correspondence on the\nother. Why should I cumber myself with regrets that the receiver is not\ncapacious? It never troubles the sun that some of his rays fall wide\nand vain into ungrateful space, and only a small part on the reflecting\nplanet. Let your greatness educate the crude and cold companion. If he\nis unequal he will presently pass away; but thou art enlarged by thy own\nshining, and no longer a mate for frogs and worms, dost soar and\nburn with the gods of the empyrean. It is thought a disgrace to love\nunrequited. But the great will see that true love cannot be unrequited.\nTrue love transcends the unworthy object and dwells and broods on the\neternal, and when the poor interposed mask crumbles, it is not sad, but\nfeels rid of so much earth and feels its independency the surer. Yet\nthese things may hardly be said without a sort of treachery to the\nrelation. The essence of friendship is entireness, a total magnanimity\nand trust. It must not surmise or provide for infirmity. It treats its\nobject as a god, that it may deify both.\n\n*****\n\n\n\n     PRUDENCE.\n\n     THEME no poet gladly sung,\n     Fair to old and foul to young;\n     Scorn not thou the love of parts,\n     And the articles of arts.\n     Grandeur of the perfect sphere\n     Thanks the atoms that cohere.\n\n\n\n\nVII. PRUDENCE.\n\nWhat right have I to write on Prudence, whereof I have Little, and\nthat of the negative sort? My prudence consists in avoiding and going\nwithout, not in the inventing of means and methods, not in adroit\nsteering, not in gentle repairing. I have no skill to make money spend\nwell, no genius in my economy, and whoever sees my garden discovers that\nI must have some other garden. Yet I love facts, and hate lubricity\nand people without perception. Then I have the same title to write\non prudence that I have to write on poetry or holiness. We write from\naspiration and antagonism, as well as from experience. We paint those\nqualities which we do not possess. The poet admires the man of energy\nand tactics; the merchant breeds his son for the church or the bar; and\nwhere a man is not vain and egotistic you shall find what he has not\nby his praise. Moreover it would be hardly honest in me not to balance\nthese fine lyric words of Love and Friendship with words of coarser\nsound, and whilst my debt to my senses is real and constant, not to own\nit in passing.\n\nPrudence is the virtue of the senses. It is the science of appearances.\nIt is the outmost action of the inward life. It is God taking thought\nfor oxen. It moves matter after the laws of matter. It is content to\nseek health of body by complying with physical conditions, and health of\nmind by the laws of the intellect.\n\nThe world of the senses is a world of shows; it does not exist for\nitself, but has a symbolic character; and a true prudence or law of\nshows recognizes the co-presence of other laws and knows that its own\noffice is subaltern; knows that it is surface and not centre where it\nworks. Prudence is false when detached. It is legitimate when it is the\nNatural History of the soul incarnate, when it unfolds the beauty of\nlaws within the narrow scope of the senses.\n\nThere are all degrees of proficiency in knowledge of the world. It is\nsufficient to our present purpose to indicate three. One class live to\nthe utility of the symbol, esteeming health and wealth a final good.\nAnother class live above this mark to the beauty of the symbol, as the\npoet and artist and the naturalist and man of science. A third\nclass live above the beauty of the symbol to the beauty of the thing\nsignified; these are wise men. The first class have common sense; the\nsecond, taste; and the third, spiritual perception. Once in a long time,\na man traverses the whole scale, and sees and enjoys the symbol solidly,\nthen also has a clear eye for its beauty, and lastly, whilst he pitches\nhis tent on this sacred volcanic isle of nature, does not offer to build\nhouses and barns thereon,--reverencing the splendor of the God which he\nsees bursting through each chink and cranny.\n\nThe world is filled with the proverbs and acts and winkings of a base\nprudence, which is a devotion to matter, as if we possessed no other\nfaculties than the palate, the nose, the touch, the eye and ear; a\nprudence which adores the Rule of Three, which never subscribes, which\nnever gives, which seldom lends, and asks but one question of any\nproject,--Will it bake bread? This is a disease like a thickening of the\nskin until the vital organs are destroyed. But culture, revealing the\nhigh origin of the apparent world and aiming at the perfection of the\nman as the end, degrades every thing else, as health and bodily life,\ninto means. It sees prudence not to be a several faculty, but a name for\nwisdom and virtue conversing with the body and its wants. Cultivated men\nalways feel and speak so, as if a great fortune, the achievement of\na civil or social measure, great personal influence, a graceful and\ncommanding address, had their value as proofs of the energy of the\nspirit. If a man lose his balance and immerse himself in any trades or\npleasures for their own sake, he may be a good wheel or pin, but he is\nnot a cultivated man.\n\nThe spurious prudence, making the senses final, is the god of sots and\ncowards, and is the subject of all comedy. It is nature's joke, and\ntherefore literature's. The true prudence limits this sensualism by\nadmitting the knowledge of an internal and real world. This recognition\nonce made, the order of the world and the distribution of affairs and\ntimes, being studied with the co-perception of their subordinate place,\nwill reward any degree of attention. For our existence, thus apparently\nattached in nature to the sun and the returning moon and the periods\nwhich they mark,--so susceptible to climate and to country, so alive to\nsocial good and evil, so fond of splendor and so tender to hunger and\ncold and debt,--reads all its primary lessons out of these books.\n\nPrudence does not go behind nature and ask whence it is. It takes the\nlaws of the world whereby man's being is conditioned, as they are, and\nkeeps these laws that it may enjoy their proper good. It respects space\nand time, climate, want, sleep, the law of polarity, growth and death.\nThere revolve, to give bound and period to his being on all sides,\nthe sun and moon, the great formalists in the sky: here lies stubborn\nmatter, and will not swerve from its chemical routine. Here is a planted\nglobe, pierced and belted with natural laws and fenced and distributed\nexternally with civil partitions and properties which impose new\nrestraints on the young inhabitant.\n\nWe eat of the bread which grows in the field. We live by the air which\nblows around us and we are poisoned by the air that is too cold or too\nhot, too dry or too wet. Time, which shows so vacant, indivisible and\ndivine in its coming, is slit and peddled into trifles and tatters. A\ndoor is to be painted, a lock to be repaired. I want wood or oil, or\nmeal or salt; the house smokes, or I have a headache; then the tax, and\nan affair to be transacted with a man without heart or brains, and the\nstinging recollection of an injurious or very awkward word,--these eat\nup the hours. Do what we can, summer will have its flies; if we walk in\nthe woods we must feed mosquitos; if we go a-fishing we must expect a\nwet coat. Then climate is a great impediment to idle persons; we often\nresolve to give up the care of the weather, but still we regard the\nclouds and the rain.\n\nWe are instructed by these petty experiences which usurp the hours and\nyears. The hard soil and four months of snow make the inhabitant of the\nnorthern temperate zone wiser and abler than his fellow who enjoys the\nfixed smile of the tropics. The islander may ramble all day at will.\nAt night he may sleep on a mat under the moon, and wherever a wild\ndate-tree grows, nature has, without a prayer even, spread a table for\nhis morning meal. The northerner is perforce a householder. He must\nbrew, bake, salt and preserve his food, and pile wood and coal. But\nas it happens that not one stroke can labor lay to without some new\nacquaintance with nature, and as nature is inexhaustibly significant,\nthe inhabitants of these climates have always excelled the southerner\nin force. Such is the value of these matters that a man who knows\nother things can never know too much of these. Let him have accurate\nperceptions. Let him, if he have hands, handle; if eyes, measure and\ndiscriminate; let him accept and hive every fact of chemistry, natural\nhistory and economics; the more he has, the less is he willing to spare\nany one. Time is always bringing the occasions that disclose their\nvalue. Some wisdom comes out of every natural and innocent action. The\ndomestic man, who loves no music so well as his kitchen clock and the\nairs which the logs sing to him as they burn on the hearth, has solaces\nwhich others never dream of. The application of means to ends insures\nvictory and the songs of victory not less in a farm or a shop than\nin the tactics of party or of war. The good husband finds method as\nefficient in the packing of fire-wood in a shed or in the harvesting\nof fruits in the cellar, as in Peninsular campaigns or the files of the\nDepartment of State. In the rainy day he builds a work-bench, or gets\nhis tool-box set in the corner of the barn-chamber, and stored with\nnails, gimlet, pincers, screwdriver and chisel. Herein he tastes an old\njoy of youth and childhood, the cat-like love of garrets, presses and\ncorn-chambers, and of the conveniences of long housekeeping. His garden\nor his poultry-yard tells him many pleasant anecdotes. One might find\nargument for optimism in the abundant flow of this saccharine element of\npleasure in every suburb and extremity of the good world. Let a man keep\nthe law,--any law,--and his way will be strown with satisfactions. There\nis more difference in the quality of our pleasures than in the amount.\n\nOn the other hand, nature punishes any neglect of prudence. If you think\nthe senses final, obey their law. If you believe in the soul, do not\nclutch at sensual sweetness before it is ripe on the slow tree of cause\nand effect. It is vinegar to the eyes to deal with men of loose and\nimperfect perception. Dr. Johnson is reported to have said,--\"If\nthe child says he looked out of this window, when he looked out of\nthat,--whip him.\" Our American character is marked by a more than\naverage delight in accurate perception, which is shown by the currency\nof the byword, \"No mistake.\" But the discomfort of unpunctuality,\nof confusion of thought about facts, of inattention to the wants of\nto-morrow, is of no nation. The beautiful laws of time and space,\nonce dislocated by our inaptitude, are holes and dens. If the hive be\ndisturbed by rash and stupid hands, instead of honey it will yield\nus bees. Our words and actions to be fair must be timely. A gay and\npleasant sound is the whetting of the scythe in the mornings of June,\nyet what is more lonesome and sad than the sound of a whetstone\nor mower's rifle when it is too late in the season to make hay?\nScatter-brained and \"afternoon\" men spoil much more than their own\naffair in spoiling the temper of those who deal with them. I have seen\na criticism on some paintings, of which I am reminded when I see the\nshiftless and unhappy men who are not true to their senses. The last\nGrand Duke of Weimar, a man of superior understanding, said,--\"I have\nsometimes remarked in the presence of great works of art, and just now\nespecially in Dresden, how much a certain property contributes to the\neffect which gives life to the figures, and to the life an irresistible\ntruth. This property is the hitting, in all the figures we draw, the\nright centre of gravity. I mean the placing the figures firm upon their\nfeet, making the hands grasp, and fastening the eyes on the spot where\nthey should look. Even lifeless figures, as vessels and stools--let them\nbe drawn ever so correctly--lose all effect so soon as they lack the\nresting upon their centre of gravity, and have a certain swimming and\noscillating appearance. The Raphael in the Dresden gallery (the only\ngreatly affecting picture which I have seen) is the quietest and most\npassionless piece you can imagine; a couple of saints who worship the\nVirgin and Child. Nevertheless, it awakens a deeper impression than\nthe contortions of ten crucified martyrs. For beside all the resistless\nbeauty of form, it possesses in the highest degree the property of the\nperpendicularity of all the figures.\" This perpendicularity we demand of\nall the figures in this picture of life. Let them stand on their feet,\nand not float and swing. Let us know where to find them. Let them\ndiscriminate between what they remember and what they dreamed, call a\nspade a spade, give us facts, and honor their own senses with trust.\n\nBut what man shall dare tax another with imprudence? Who is prudent? The\nmen we call greatest are least in this kingdom. There is a certain fatal\ndislocation in our relation to nature, distorting our modes of living\nand making every law our enemy, which seems at last to have aroused all\nthe wit and virtue in the world to ponder the question of Reform. We\nmust call the highest prudence to counsel, and ask why health and beauty\nand genius should now be the exception rather than the rule of human\nnature? We do not know the properties of plants and animals and the\nlaws of nature, through our sympathy with the same; but this remains the\ndream of poets. Poetry and prudence should be coincident. Poets should\nbe lawgivers; that is, the boldest lyric inspiration should not chide\nand insult, but should announce and lead the civil code and the day's\nwork. But now the two things seem irreconcilably parted. We have\nviolated law upon law until we stand amidst ruins, and when by chance we\nespy a coincidence between reason and the phenomena, we are surprised.\nBeauty should be the dowry of every man and woman, as invariably as\nsensation; but it is rare. Health or sound organization should be\nuniversal. Genius should be the child of genius and every child should\nbe inspired; but now it is not to be predicted of any child, and nowhere\nis it pure. We call partial half-lights, by courtesy, genius; talent\nwhich converts itself to money; talent which glitters to-day that it may\ndine and sleep well to-morrow; and society is officered by men of parts,\nas they are properly called, and not by divine men. These use their\ngifts to refine luxury, not to abolish it. Genius is always ascetic,\nand piety, and love. Appetite shows to the finer souls as a disease, and\nthey find beauty in rites and bounds that resist it.\n\nWe have found out fine names to cover our sensuality withal, but no\ngifts can raise intemperance. The man of talent affects to call his\ntransgressions of the laws of the senses trivial and to count them\nnothing considered with his devotion to his art. His art never taught\nhim lewdness, nor the love of wine, nor the wish to reap where he had\nnot sowed. His art is less for every deduction from his holiness, and\nless for every defect of common sense. On him who scorned the world as\nhe said, the scorned world wreaks its revenge. He that despiseth small\nthings will perish by little and little. Goethe's Tasso is very likely\nto be a pretty fair historical portrait, and that is true tragedy. It\ndoes not seem to me so genuine grief when some tyrannous Richard the\nThird oppresses and slays a score of innocent persons, as when Antonio\nand Tasso, both apparently right, wrong each other. One living after the\nmaxims of this world and consistent and true to them, the other fired\nwith all divine sentiments, yet grasping also at the pleasures of sense,\nwithout submitting to their law. That is a grief we all feel, a knot we\ncannot untie. Tasso's is no infrequent case in modern biography. A\nman of genius, of an ardent temperament, reckless of physical\nlaws, self-indulgent, becomes presently unfortunate, querulous, a\n\"discomfortable cousin,\" a thorn to himself and to others.\n\nThe scholar shames us by his bifold life. Whilst something higher than\nprudence is active, he is admirable; when common sense is wanted, he is\nan encumbrance. Yesterday, Caesar was not so great; to-day, the felon\nat the gallows' foot is not more miserable. Yesterday, radiant with the\nlight of an ideal world in which he lives, the first of men; and now\noppressed by wants and by sickness, for which he must thank himself. He\nresembles the pitiful drivellers whom travellers describe as frequenting\nthe bazaars of Constantinople, who skulk about all day, yellow,\nemaciated, ragged, sneaking; and at evening, when the bazaars are open,\nslink to the opium-shop, swallow their morsel and become tranquil and\nglorified seers. And who has not seen the tragedy of imprudent genius\nstruggling for years with paltry pecuniary difficulties, at last\nsinking, chilled, exhausted and fruitless, like a giant slaughtered by\npins?\n\nIs it not better that a man should accept the first pains and\nmortifications of this sort, which nature is not slack in sending him,\nas hints that he must expect no other good than the just fruit of his\nown labor and self-denial? Health, bread, climate, social position, have\ntheir importance, and he will give them their due. Let him esteem Nature\na perpetual counsellor, and her perfections the exact measure of our\ndeviations. Let him make the night night, and the day day. Let him\ncontrol the habit of expense. Let him see that as much wisdom may be\nexpended on a private economy as on an empire, and as much wisdom may\nbe drawn from it. The laws of the world are written out for him on every\npiece of money in his hand. There is nothing he will not be the\nbetter for knowing, were it only the wisdom of Poor Richard, or the\nState-Street prudence of buying by the acre to sell by the foot; or the\nthrift of the agriculturist, to stick a tree between whiles, because it\nwill grow whilst he sleeps; or the prudence which consists in husbanding\nlittle strokes of the tool, little portions of time, particles of stock\nand small gains. The eye of prudence may never shut. Iron, if kept at\nthe ironmonger's, will rust; beer, if not brewed in the right state of\nthe atmosphere, will sour; timber of ships will rot at sea, or if laid\nup high and dry, will strain, warp and dry-rot; money, if kept by\nus, yields no rent and is liable to loss; if invested, is liable to\ndepreciation of the particular kind of stock. Strike, says the smith,\nthe iron is white; keep the rake, says the haymaker, as nigh the scythe\nas you can, and the cart as nigh the rake. Our Yankee trade is reputed\nto be very much on the extreme of this prudence. It takes bank-notes,\ngood, bad, clean, ragged, and saves itself by the speed with which it\npasses them off. Iron cannot rust, nor beer sour, nor timber rot, nor\ncalicoes go out of fashion, nor money stocks depreciate, in the few\nswift moments in which the Yankee suffers any one of them to remain in\nhis possession. In skating over thin ice our safety is in our speed.\n\nLet him learn a prudence of a higher strain. Let him learn that every\nthing in nature, even motes and feathers, go by law and not by luck, and\nthat what he sows he reaps. By diligence and self-command let him put\nthe bread he eats at his own disposal, that he may not stand in bitter\nand false relations to other men; for the best good of wealth is\nfreedom. Let him practise the minor virtues. How much of human life is\nlost in waiting! let him not make his fellow-creatures wait. How many\nwords and promises are promises of conversation! Let his be words of\nfate. When he sees a folded and sealed scrap of paper float round the\nglobe in a pine ship and come safe to the eye for which it was written,\namidst a swarming population, let him likewise feel the admonition to\nintegrate his being across all these distracting forces, and keep a\nslender human word among the storms, distances and accidents that drive\nus hither and thither, and, by persistency, make the paltry force of\none man reappear to redeem its pledge after months and years in the most\ndistant climates.\n\nWe must not try to write the laws of any one virtue, looking at that\nonly. Human nature loves no contradictions, but is symmetrical. The\nprudence which secures an outward well-being is not to be studied by one\nset of men, whilst heroism and holiness are studied by another, but they\nare reconcilable. Prudence concerns the present time, persons, property\nand existing forms. But as every fact hath its roots in the soul, and\nif the soul were changed, would cease to be, or would become some other\nthing,--the proper administration of outward things will always rest\non a just apprehension of their cause and origin; that is, the good\nman will be the wise man, and the single-hearted the politic man. Every\nviolation of truth is not only a sort of suicide in the liar, but is\na stab at the health of human society. On the most profitable lie the\ncourse of events presently lays a destructive tax; whilst frankness\ninvites frankness, puts the parties on a convenient footing and makes\ntheir business a friendship. Trust men and they will be true to you;\ntreat them greatly and they will show themselves great, though they make\nan exception in your favor to all their rules of trade.\n\nSo, in regard to disagreeable and formidable things, prudence does not\nconsist in evasion or in flight, but in courage. He who wishes to walk\nin the most peaceful parts of life with any serenity must screw himself\nup to resolution. Let him front the object of his worst apprehension,\nand his stoutness will commonly make his fear groundless. The\nLatin proverb says, \"In battles the eye is first overcome.\" Entire\nself-possession may make a battle very little more dangerous to life\nthan a match at foils or at football. Examples are cited by soldiers of\nmen who have seen the cannon pointed and the fire given to it, and who\nhave stepped aside from the path of the ball. The terrors of the storm\nare chiefly confined to the parlor and the cabin. The drover, the\nsailor, buffets it all day, and his health renews itself at as vigorous\na pulse under the sleet as under the sun of June.\n\nIn the occurrence of unpleasant things among neighbors, fear comes\nreadily to heart and magnifies the consequence of the other party;\nbut it is a bad counsellor. Every man is actually weak and apparently\nstrong. To himself he seems weak; to others, formidable. You are afraid\nof Grim; but Grim also is afraid of you. You are solicitous of the\ngood-will of the meanest person, uneasy at his ill-will. But the\nsturdiest offender of your peace and of the neighborhood, if you rip\nup his claims, is as thin and timid as any, and the peace of society is\noften kept, because, as children say, one is afraid, and the other dares\nnot. Far off, men swell, bully and threaten; bring them hand to hand,\nand they are a feeble folk.\n\nIt is a proverb that 'courtesy costs nothing'; but calculation might\ncome to value love for its profit. Love is fabled to be blind, but\nkindness is necessary to perception; love is not a hood, but an\neye-water. If you meet a sectary or a hostile partisan, never recognize\nthe dividing lines, but meet on what common ground remains,--if only\nthat the sun shines and the rain rains for both; the area will widen\nvery fast, and ere you know it, the boundary mountains on which the eye\nhad fastened have melted into air. If they set out to contend, Saint\nPaul will lie and Saint John will hate. What low, poor, paltry,\nhypocritical people an argument on religion will make of the pure and\nchosen souls! They will shuffle and crow, crook and hide, feign to\nconfess here, only that they may brag and conquer there, and not a\nthought has enriched either party, and not an emotion of bravery,\nmodesty, or hope. So neither should you put yourself in a false\nposition with your contemporaries by indulging a vein of hostility and\nbitterness. Though your views are in straight antagonism to theirs,\nassume an identity of sentiment, assume that you are saying precisely\nthat which all think, and in the flow of wit and love roll out your\nparadoxes in solid column, with not the infirmity of a doubt. So at\nleast shall you get an adequate deliverance. The natural motions of the\nsoul are so much better than the voluntary ones that you will never do\nyourself justice in dispute. The thought is not then taken hold of by\nthe right handle, does not show itself proportioned and in its true\nbearings, but bears extorted, hoarse, and half witness. But assume a\nconsent and it shall presently be granted, since really and underneath\ntheir external diversities, all men are of one heart and mind.\n\nWisdom will never let us stand with any man or men on an unfriendly\nfooting. We refuse sympathy and intimacy with people, as if we waited\nfor some better sympathy and intimacy to come. But whence and when?\nTo-morrow will be like to-day. Life wastes itself whilst we are\npreparing to live. Our friends and fellow-workers die off from us.\nScarcely can we say we see new men, new women, approaching us. We are\ntoo old to regard fashion, too old to expect patronage of any greater\nor more powerful. Let us suck the sweetness of those affections and\nconsuetudes that grow near us. These old shoes are easy to the feet.\nUndoubtedly we can easily pick faults in our company, can easily whisper\nnames prouder, and that tickle the fancy more. Every man's imagination\nhath its friends; and life would be dearer with such companions. But if\nyou cannot have them on good mutual terms, you cannot have them. If\nnot the Deity but our ambition hews and shapes the new relations, their\nvirtue escapes, as strawberries lose their flavor in garden-beds.\n\nThus truth, frankness, courage, love, humility and all the virtues range\nthemselves on the side of prudence, or the art of securing a present\nwell-being. I do not know if all matter will be found to be made of one\nelement, as oxygen or hydrogen, at last, but the world of manners and\nactions is wrought of one stuff, and begin where we will we are pretty\nsure in a short space to be mumbling our ten commandments.\n\n*****\n\n\n\n     HEROISM.\n\n     \"Paradise is under the shadow of swords.\"\n                                   Mahomet.\n\n     RUBY wine is drunk by knaves,\n     Sugar spends to fatten slaves,\n     Rose and vine-leaf deck buffoons;\n     Thunderclouds are Jove's festoons,\n     Drooping oft in wreaths of dread\n     Lightning-knotted round his head;\n     The hero is not fed on sweets,\n     Daily his own heart he eats;\n     Chambers of the great are jails,\n     And head-winds right for royal sails.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. HEROISM.\n\nIn the elder English dramatists, and mainly in the plays Of Beaumont and\nFletcher, there is a constant recognition of gentility, as if a noble\nbehavior were as easily marked in the society of their age as color is\nin our American population. When any Rodrigo, Pedro or Valerio enters,\nthough he be a stranger, the duke or governor exclaims, 'This is a\ngentleman,--and proffers civilities without end; but all the rest are\nslag and refuse. In harmony with this delight in personal advantages\nthere is in their plays a certain heroic cast of character and\ndialogue,--as in Bonduca, Sophocles, the Mad Lover, the Double\nMarriage,--wherein the speaker is so earnest and cordial and on\nsuch deep grounds of character, that the dialogue, on the slightest\nadditional incident in the plot, rises naturally into poetry. Among many\ntexts take the following. The Roman Martius has conquered Athens,--all\nbut the invincible spirits of Sophocles, the duke of Athens, and\nDorigen, his wife. The beauty of the latter inflames Martius, and he\nseeks to save her husband; but Sophocles will not ask his life, although\nassured that a word will save him, and the execution of both proceeds:--\n\n     Valerius. Bid thy wife farewell.\n\n     Soph. No, I will take no leave. My Dorigen,\n     Yonder, above, 'bout Ariadne's crown,\n     My spirit shall hover for thee. Prithee, haste.\n\n     Dor. Stay, Sophocles,--with this tie up my sight;\n     Let not soft nature so transformed be,\n     And lose her gentler sexed humanity,\n     To make me see my lord bleed. So, 'tis well;\n     Never one object underneath the sun\n     Will I behold before my Sophocles:\n     Farewell; now teach the Romans how to die.\n\n     Mar. Dost know what 't is to die?\n\n     Soph. Thou dost not, Martius,\n     And, therefore, not what 'tis to live; to die\n     Is to begin to live. It is to end\n     An old, stale, weary work, and to commence\n     A newer and a better. 'Tis to leave\n     Deceitful knaves for the society\n     Of gods and goodness. Thou thyself must part\n     At last from all thy garlands, pleasures, triumphs,\n     And prove thy fortitude what then 't will do.\n\n     Val. But art not grieved nor vexed to leave thy life thus?\n\n     Soph. Why should I grieve or vex for being sent\n     To them I ever loved best? Now I'll kneel,\n     But with my back toward thee; 'tis the last duty\n     This trunk can do the gods.\n\n     Mar. Strike, strike, Valerius,\n     Or Martius' heart will leap out at his mouth.\n     This is a man, a woman. Kiss thy lord,\n     And live with all the freedom you were wont.\n     O love! thou doubly hast afflicted me\n     With virtue and with beauty. Treacherous heart,\n     My hand shall cast thee quick into my urn,\n     Ere thou transgress this knot of piety.\n\n     Val. What ails my brother?\n\n     Soph. Martius, O Martius,\n     Thou now hast found a way to conquer me.\n\n     Dor. O star of Rome! what gratitude can speak\n     Fit words to follow such a deed as this?\n\n     Mar. This admirable duke, Valerius,\n     With his disdain of fortune and of death,\n     Captived himself, has captivated me,\n     And though my arm hath ta'en his body here,\n     His soul hath subjugated Martius' soul.\n     By Romulus, he is all soul, I think;\n     He hath no flesh, and spirit cannot be gyved;\n     Then we have vanquished nothing; he is free,\n     And Martius walks now in captivity.\n\nI do not readily remember any poem, play, sermon, novel, or oration that\nour press vents in the last few years, which goes to the same tune. We\nhave a great many flutes and flageolets, but not often the sound of\nany fife. Yet, Wordsworth's \"Laodamia,\" and the ode of \"Dion,\" and some\nsonnets, have a certain noble music; and Scott will sometimes draw a\nstroke like the portrait of Lord Evandale given by Balfour of Burley.\nThomas Carlyle, with his natural taste for what is manly and daring in\ncharacter, has suffered no heroic trait in his favorites to drop from\nhis biographical and historical pictures. Earlier, Robert Burns has\ngiven us a song or two. In the Harleian Miscellanies there is an account\nof the battle of Lutzen which deserves to be read. And Simon Ockley's\nHistory of the Saracens recounts the prodigies of individual valor,\nwith admiration all the more evident on the part of the narrator that he\nseems to think that his place in Christian Oxford requires of him some\nproper protestations of abhorrence. But if we explore the literature\nof Heroism we shall quickly come to Plutarch, who is its Doctor and\nhistorian. To him we owe the Brasidas, the Dion, the Epaminondas, the\nScipio of old, and I must think we are more deeply indebted to him than\nto all the ancient writers. Each of his \"Lives\" is a refutation to the\ndespondency and cowardice of our religious and political theorists. A\nwild courage, a Stoicism not of the schools but of the blood, shines in\nevery anecdote, and has given that book its immense fame.\n\nWe need books of this tart cathartic virtue more than books of political\nscience or of private economy. Life is a festival only to the wise.\nSeen from the nook and chimney-side of prudence, it wears a ragged\nand dangerous front. The violations of the laws of nature by our\npredecessors and our contemporaries are punished in us also. The disease\nand deformity around us certify the infraction of natural, intellectual,\nand moral laws, and often violation on violation to breed such\ncompound misery. A lock-jaw that bends a man's head back to his heels;\nhydrophobia that makes him bark at his wife and babes; insanity that\nmakes him eat grass; war, plague, cholera, famine, indicate a certain\nferocity in nature, which, as it had its inlet by human crime, must have\nits outlet by human suffering. Unhappily no man exists who has not in\nhis own person become to some amount a stockholder in the sin, and so\nmade himself liable to a share in the expiation.\n\nOur culture therefore must not omit the arming of the man. Let him\nhear in season that he is born into the state of war, and that the\ncommonwealth and his own well-being require that he should not go\ndancing in the weeds of peace, but warned, self-collected and neither\ndefying nor dreading the thunder, let him take both reputation and life\nin his hand, and, with perfect urbanity dare the gibbet and the mob by\nthe absolute truth of his speech and the rectitude of his behavior.\n\nTowards all this external evil the man within the breast assumes a\nwarlike attitude, and affirms his ability to cope single-handed with the\ninfinite army of enemies. To this military attitude of the soul we give\nthe name of Heroism. Its rudest form is the contempt for safety and\nease, which makes the attractiveness of war. It is a self-trust which\nslights the restraints of prudence, in the plenitude of its energy and\npower to repair the harms it may suffer. The hero is a mind of such\nbalance that no disturbances can shake his will, but pleasantly and as\nit were merrily he advances to his own music, alike in frightful alarms\nand in the tipsy mirth of universal dissoluteness. There is somewhat not\nphilosophical in heroism; there is somewhat not holy in it; it seems not\nto know that other souls are of one texture with it; it has pride; it is\nthe extreme of individual nature. Nevertheless we must profoundly revere\nit. There is somewhat in great actions which does not allow us to go\nbehind them. Heroism feels and never reasons, and therefore is always\nright; and although a different breeding, different religion and\ngreater intellectual activity would have modified or even reversed the\nparticular action, yet for the hero that thing he does is the highest\ndeed, and is not open to the censure of philosophers or divines. It is\nthe avowal of the unschooled man that he finds a quality in him that\nis negligent of expense, of health, of life, of danger, of hatred, of\nreproach, and knows that his will is higher and more excellent than all\nactual and all possible antagonists.\n\nHeroism works in contradiction to the voice of mankind and in\ncontradiction, for a time, to the voice of the great and good. Heroism\nis an obedience to a secret impulse of an individual's character. Now to\nno other man can its wisdom appear as it does to him, for every man must\nbe supposed to see a little farther on his own proper path than any one\nelse. Therefore just and wise men take umbrage at his act, until after\nsome little time be past: then they see it to be in unison with their\nacts. All prudent men see that the action is clean contrary to a sensual\nprosperity; for every heroic act measures itself by its contempt of\nsome external good. But it finds its own success at last, and then the\nprudent also extol.\n\nSelf-trust is the essence of heroism. It is the state of the soul at\nwar, and its ultimate objects are the last defiance of falsehood and\nwrong, and the power to bear all that can be inflicted by evil agents.\nIt speaks the truth and it is just, generous, hospitable, temperate,\nscornful of petty calculations and scornful of being scorned. It\npersists; it is of an undaunted boldness and of a fortitude not to\nbe wearied out. Its jest is the littleness of common life. That false\nprudence which dotes on health and wealth is the butt and merriment of\nheroism. Heroism, like Plotinus, is almost ashamed of its body. What\nshall it say then to the sugar-plums and cats'-cradles, to the toilet,\ncompliments, quarrels, cards and custard, which rack the wit of all\nsociety? What joys has kind nature provided for us dear creatures! There\nseems to be no interval between greatness and meanness. When the spirit\nis not master of the world, then it is its dupe. Yet the little\nman takes the great hoax so innocently, works in it so headlong and\nbelieving, is born red, and dies gray, arranging his toilet, attending\non his own health, laying traps for sweet food and strong wine, setting\nhis heart on a horse or a rifle, made happy with a little gossip or\na little praise, that the great soul cannot choose but laugh at such\nearnest nonsense. \"Indeed, these humble considerations make me out of\nlove with greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to take note how many\npairs of silk stockings thou hast, namely, these and those that were the\npeach-colored ones; or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as one for\nsuperfluity, and one other for use!\"\n\nCitizens, thinking after the laws of arithmetic, consider the\ninconvenience of receiving strangers at their fireside, reckon narrowly\nthe loss of time and the unusual display; the soul of a better quality\nthrusts back the unseasonable economy into the vaults of life, and says,\nI will obey the God, and the sacrifice and the fire he will provide.\nIbn Hankal, the Arabian geographer, describes a heroic extreme in the\nhospitality of Sogd, in Bukharia. \"When I was in Sogd I saw a great\nbuilding, like a palace, the gates of which were open and fixed back\nto the wall with large nails. I asked the reason, and was told that the\nhouse had not been shut, night or day, for a hundred years. Strangers\nmay present themselves at any hour and in whatever number; the master\nhas amply provided for the reception of the men and their animals, and\nis never happier than when they tarry for some time. Nothing of the kind\nhave I seen in any other country.\" The magnanimous know very well that\nthey who give time, or money, or shelter, to the stranger,--so it be\ndone for love and not for ostentation,--do, as it were, put God under\nobligation to them, so perfect are the compensations of the universe. In\nsome way the time they seem to lose is redeemed and the pains they seem\nto take remunerate themselves. These men fan the flame of human love and\nraise the standard of civil virtue among mankind. But hospitality must\nbe for service and not for show, or it pulls down the host. The brave\nsoul rates itself too high to value itself by the splendor of its table\nand draperies. It gives what it hath, and all it hath, but its own\nmajesty can lend a better grace to bannocks and fair water than belong\nto city feasts.\n\nThe temperance of the hero proceeds from the same wish to do no dishonor\nto the worthiness he has. But he loves it for its elegancy, not for its\nausterity. It seems not worth his while to be solemn and denounce with\nbitterness flesh-eating or wine-drinking, the use of tobacco, or opium,\nor tea, or silk, or gold. A great man scarcely knows how he dines, how\nhe dresses; but without railing or precision his living is natural\nand poetic. John Eliot, the Indian Apostle, drank water, and said of\nwine,--\"It is a noble, generous liquor and we should be humbly thankful\nfor it, but, as I remember, water was made before it.\" Better still is\nthe temperance of King David, who poured out on the ground unto the Lord\nthe water which three of his warriors had brought him to drink, at the\nperil of their lives.\n\nIt is told of Brutus, that when he fell on his sword after the battle\nof Philippi, he quoted a line of Euripides,--\"O Virtue! I have followed\nthee through life, and I find thee at last but a shade.\" I doubt not\nthe hero is slandered by this report. The heroic soul does not sell its\njustice and its nobleness. It does not ask to dine nicely and to sleep\nwarm. The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough.\nPoverty is its ornament. It does not need plenty, and can very well\nabide its loss.\n\nBut that which takes my fancy most in the heroic class, is the\ngood-humor and hilarity they exhibit. It is a height to which common\nduty can very well attain, to suffer and to dare with solemnity. But\nthese rare souls set opinion, success, and life at so cheap a rate that\nthey will not soothe their enemies by petitions, or the show of sorrow,\nbut wear their own habitual greatness. Scipio, charged with peculation,\nrefuses to do himself so great a disgrace as to wait for justification,\nthough he had the scroll of his accounts in his hands, but tears it to\npieces before the tribunes. Socrates's condemnation of himself to be\nmaintained in all honor in the Prytaneum, during his life, and Sir\nThomas More's playfulness at the scaffold, are of the same strain. In\nBeaumont and Fletcher's \"Sea Voyage,\" Juletta tells the stout captain\nand his company,--\n\n     Jul. Why, slaves, 'tis in our power to hang ye.\n     Master. Very likely,\n     'Tis in our powers, then, to be hanged, and scorn ye.\n\nThese replies are sound and whole. Sport is the bloom and glow of\na perfect health. The great will not condescend to take any thing\nseriously; all must be as gay as the song of a canary, though it were\nthe building of cities or the eradication of old and foolish churches\nand nations which have cumbered the earth long thousands of years.\nSimple hearts put all the history and customs of this world behind them,\nand play their own game in innocent defiance of the Blue-Laws of the\nworld; and such would appear, could we see the human race assembled in\nvision, like little children frolicking together, though to the eyes\nof mankind at large they wear a stately and solemn garb of works and\ninfluences.\n\nThe interest these fine stories have for us, the power of a romance over\nthe boy who grasps the forbidden book under his bench at school, our\ndelight in the hero, is the main fact to our purpose. All these great\nand transcendent properties are ours. If we dilate in beholding the\nGreek energy, the Roman pride, it is that we are already domesticating\nthe same sentiment. Let us find room for this great guest in our small\nhouses. The first step of worthiness will be to disabuse us of our\nsuperstitious associations with places and times, with number and size.\nWhy should these words, Athenian, Roman, Asia and England, so tingle in\nthe ear? Where the heart is, there the muses, there the gods sojourn,\nand not in any geography of fame. Massachusetts, Connecticut River and\nBoston Bay you think paltry places, and the ear loves names of foreign\nand classic topography. But here we are; and, if we will tarry a little,\nwe may come to learn that here is best. See to it only that thyself is\nhere, and art and nature, hope and fate, friends, angels and the\nSupreme Being shall not be absent from the chamber where thou sittest.\nEpaminondas, brave and affectionate, does not seem to us to need Olympus\nto die upon, nor the Syrian sunshine. He lies very well where he is. The\nJerseys were handsome ground enough for Washington to tread, and London\nstreets for the feet of Milton. A great man makes his climate genial in\nthe imagination of men, and its air the beloved element of all delicate\nspirits. That country is the fairest which is inhabited by the noblest\nminds. The pictures which fill the imagination in reading the actions\nof Pericles, Xenophon, Columbus, Bayard, Sidney, Hampden, teach us how\nneedlessly mean our life is; that we, by the depth of our living, should\ndeck it with more than regal or national splendor, and act on principles\nthat should interest man and nature in the length of our days.\n\nWe have seen or heard of many extraordinary young men who never ripened,\nor whose performance in actual life was not extraordinary. When we see\ntheir air and mien, when we hear them speak of society, of books, of\nreligion, we admire their superiority; they seem to throw contempt on\nour entire polity and social state; theirs is the tone of a youthful\ngiant who is sent to work revolutions. But they enter an active\nprofession and the forming Colossus shrinks to the common size of man.\nThe magic they used was the ideal tendencies, which always make the\nActual ridiculous; but the tough world had its revenge the moment they\nput their horses of the sun to plough in its furrow. They found no\nexample and no companion, and their heart fainted. What then? The lesson\nthey gave in their first aspirations is yet true; and a better valor and\na purer truth shall one day organize their belief. Or why should a woman\nliken herself to any historical woman, and think, because Sappho, or\nSevigne, or De Stael, or the cloistered souls who have had genius and\ncultivation do not satisfy the imagination and the serene Themis, none\ncan,--certainly not she? Why not? She has a new and unattempted problem\nto solve, perchance that of the happiest nature that ever bloomed. Let\nthe maiden, with erect soul, walk serenely on her way, accept the hint\nof each new experience, search in turn all the objects that solicit her\neye, that she may learn the power and the charm of her new-born being,\nwhich is the kindling of a new dawn in the recesses of space. The\nfair girl who repels interference by a decided and proud choice of\ninfluences, so careless of pleasing, so wilful and lofty, inspires every\nbeholder with somewhat of her own nobleness. The silent heart encourages\nher; O friend, never strike sail to a fear! Come into port greatly, or\nsail with God the seas. Not in vain you live, for every passing eye is\ncheered and refined by the vision.\n\nThe characteristic of heroism is its persistency. All men have wandering\nimpulses, fits and starts of generosity. But when you have chosen your\npart, abide by it, and do not weakly try to reconcile yourself with the\nworld. The heroic cannot be the common, nor the common the heroic. Yet\nwe have the weakness to expect the sympathy of people in those actions\nwhose excellence is that they outrun sympathy and appeal to a tardy\njustice. If you would serve your brother, because it is fit for you to\nserve him, do not take back your words when you find that prudent people\ndo not commend you. Adhere to your own act, and congratulate yourself if\nyou have done something strange and extravagant and broken the monotony\nof a decorous age. It was a high counsel that I once heard given to a\nyoung person,--\"Always do what you are afraid to do.\" A simple manly\ncharacter need never make an apology, but should regard its past action\nwith the calmness of Phocion, when he admitted that the event of the\nbattle was happy, yet did not regret his dissuasion from the battle.\n\nThere is no weakness or exposure for which we cannot find consolation in\nthe thought--this is a part of my constitution, part of my relation\nand office to my fellow-creature. Has nature covenanted with me that I\nshould never appear to disadvantage, never make a ridiculous figure? Let\nus be generous of our dignity as well as of our money. Greatness once\nand for ever has done with opinion. We tell our charities, not because\nwe wish to be praised for them, not because we think they have great\nmerit, but for our justification. It is a capital blunder; as you\ndiscover when another man recites his charities.\n\nTo speak the truth, even with some austerity, to live with some rigor\nof temperance, or some extremes of generosity, seems to be an asceticism\nwhich common good-nature would appoint to those who are at ease and in\nplenty, in sign that they feel a brotherhood with the great multitude\nof suffering men. And not only need we breathe and exercise the soul\nby assuming the penalties of abstinence, of debt, of solitude, of\nunpopularity,--but it behooves the wise man to look with a bold eye\ninto those rarer dangers which sometimes invade men, and to familiarize\nhimself with disgusting forms of disease, with sounds of execration, and\nthe vision of violent death.\n\nTimes of heroism are generally times of terror, but the day never shines\nin which this element may not work. The circumstances of man, we say,\nare historically somewhat better in this country and at this hour than\nperhaps ever before. More freedom exists for culture. It will not now\nrun against an axe at the first step out of the beaten track of opinion.\nBut whoso is heroic will always find crises to try his edge. Human\nvirtue demands her champions and martyrs, and the trial of persecution\nalways proceeds. It is but the other day that the brave Lovejoy gave\nhis breast to the bullets of a mob, for the rights of free speech and\nopinion, and died when it was better not to live.\n\nI see not any road of perfect peace which a man can walk, but after the\ncounsel of his own bosom. Let him quit too much association, let him\ngo home much, and stablish himself in those courses he approves. The\nunremitting retention of simple and high sentiments in obscure duties\nis hardening the character to that temper which will work with honor,\nif need be in the tumult, or on the scaffold. Whatever outrages have\nhappened to men may befall a man again; and very easily in a republic,\nif there appear any signs of a decay of religion. Coarse slander, fire,\ntar and feathers and the gibbet, the youth may freely bring home to his\nmind and with what sweetness of temper he can, and inquire how fast\nhe can fix his sense of duty, braving such penalties, whenever it may\nplease the next newspaper and a sufficient number of his neighbors to\npronounce his opinions incendiary.\n\nIt may calm the apprehension of calamity in the most susceptible heart\nto see how quick a bound Nature has set to the utmost infliction of\nmalice. We rapidly approach a brink over which no enemy can follow us:--\n\n          \"Let them rave:\n     Thou art quiet in thy grave.\"\n\nIn the gloom of our ignorance of what shall be, in the hour when we are\ndeaf to the higher voices, who does not envy those who have seen safely\nto an end their manful endeavor? Who that sees the meanness of our\npolitics but inly congratulates Washington that he is long already\nwrapped in his shroud, and for ever safe; that he was laid sweet in\nhis grave, the hope of humanity not yet subjugated in him? Who does not\nsometimes envy the good and brave who are no more to suffer from the\ntumults of the natural world, and await with curious complacency the\nspeedy term of his own conversation with finite nature? And yet the love\nthat will be annihilated sooner than treacherous has already made death\nimpossible, and affirms itself no mortal but a native of the deeps of\nabsolute and inextinguishable being.\n\n*****\n\n\n\n     THE OVER-SOUL.\n\n     \"BUT souls that of his own good life partake,\n     He loves as his own self; dear as his eye\n     They are to Him: He'll never them forsake:\n     When they shall die, then God himself shall die:\n     They live, they live in blest eternity.\"\n                                        Henry More.\n\n     Space is ample, east and west,\n     But two cannot go abreast,\n     Cannot travel in it two:\n     Yonder masterful cuckoo\n     Crowds every egg out of the nest,\n     Quick or dead, except its own;\n     A spell is laid on sod and stone,\n     Night and Day 've been tampered with,\n     Every quality and pith\n     Surcharged and sultry with a power\n     That works its will on age and hour.\n\n\n\n\nIX. THE OVER-SOUL.\n\nTHERE is a difference between one and another hour of life in their\nauthority and subsequent effect. Our faith comes in moments; our vice is\nhabitual. Yet there is a depth in those brief moments which constrains\nus to ascribe more reality to them than to all other experiences. For\nthis reason the argument which is always forthcoming to silence\nthose who conceive extraordinary hopes of man, namely the appeal to\nexperience, is for ever invalid and vain. We give up the past to the\nobjector, and yet we hope. He must explain this hope. We grant that\nhuman life is mean, but how did we find out that it was mean? What is\nthe ground of this uneasiness of ours; of this old discontent? What\nis the universal sense of want and ignorance, but the fine innuendo\nby which the soul makes its enormous claim? Why do men feel that the\nnatural history of man has never been written, but he is always leaving\nbehind what you have said of him, and it becomes old, and books of\nmetaphysics worthless? The philosophy of six thousand years has not\nsearched the chambers and magazines of the soul. In its experiments\nthere has always remained, in the last analysis, a residuum it could not\nresolve. Man is a stream whose source is hidden. Our being is descending\ninto us from we know not whence. The most exact calculator has no\nprescience that somewhat incalculable may not balk the very next moment.\nI am constrained every moment to acknowledge a higher origin for events\nthan the will I call mine.\n\nAs with events, so is it with thoughts. When I watch that flowing river,\nwhich, out of regions I see not, pours for a season its streams into me,\nI see that I am a pensioner; not a cause, but a surprised spectator of\nthis ethereal water; that I desire and look up and put myself in the\nattitude of reception, but from some alien energy the visions come.\n\nThe Supreme Critic on the errors of the past and the present, and the\nonly prophet of that which must be, is that great nature in which we\nrest as the earth lies in the soft arms of the atmosphere; that Unity,\nthat Over-soul, within which every man's particular being is contained\nand made one with all other; that common heart of which all sincere\nconversation is the worship, to which all right action is submission;\nthat overpowering reality which confutes our tricks and talents, and\nconstrains every one to pass for what he is, and to speak from his\ncharacter and not from his tongue, and which evermore tends to pass into\nour thought and hand and become wisdom and virtue and power and beauty.\nWe live in succession, in division, in parts, in particles. Meantime\nwithin man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal\nbeauty, to which every part and particle is equally related; the eternal\nONE. And this deep power in which we exist and whose beatitude is all\naccessible to us, is not only self-sufficing and perfect in every hour,\nbut the act of seeing and the thing seen, the seer and the spectacle,\nthe subject and the object, are one. We see the world piece by piece, as\nthe sun, the moon, the animal, the tree; but the whole, of which these\nare the shining parts, is the soul. Only by the vision of that Wisdom\ncan the horoscope of the ages be read, and by falling back on our better\nthoughts, by yielding to the spirit of prophecy which is innate in every\nman, we can know what it saith. Every man's words who speaks from that\nlife must sound vain to those who do not dwell in the same thought\non their own part. I dare not speak for it. My words do not carry its\naugust sense; they fall short and cold. Only itself can inspire whom\nit will, and behold! their speech shall be lyrical, and sweet, and\nuniversal as the rising of the wind. Yet I desire, even by profane\nwords, if I may not use sacred, to indicate the heaven of this deity and\nto report what hints I have collected of the transcendent simplicity and\nenergy of the Highest Law.\n\nIf we consider what happens in conversation, in reveries, in remorse, in\ntimes of passion, in surprises, in the instructions of dreams, wherein\noften we see ourselves in masquerade,--the droll disguises only\nmagnifying and enhancing a real element and forcing it on our distinct\nnotice,--we shall catch many hints that will broaden and lighten into\nknowledge of the secret of nature. All goes to show that the soul in\nman is not an organ, but animates and exercises all the organs; is not\na function, like the power of memory, of calculation, of comparison, but\nuses these as hands and feet; is not a faculty, but a light; is not the\nintellect or the will, but the master of the intellect and the will;\nis the background of our being, in which they lie,--an immensity not\npossessed and that cannot be possessed. From within or from behind,\na light shines through us upon things and makes us aware that we are\nnothing, but the light is all. A man is the facade of a temple wherein\nall wisdom and all good abide. What we commonly call man, the eating,\ndrinking, planting, counting man, does not, as we know him, represent\nhimself, but misrepresents himself. Him we do not respect, but the soul,\nwhose organ he is, would he let it appear through his action, would make\nour knees bend. When it breathes through his intellect, it is genius;\nwhen it breathes through his will, it is virtue; when it flows through\nhis affection, it is love. And the blindness of the intellect begins\nwhen it would be something of itself. The weakness of the will begins\nwhen the individual would be something of himself. All reform aims in\nsome one particular to let the soul have its way through us; in other\nwords, to engage us to obey.\n\nOf this pure nature every man is at some time sensible. Language\ncannot paint it with his colors. It is too subtile. It is undefinable,\nunmeasurable; but we know that it pervades and contains us. We know that\nall spiritual being is in man. A wise old proverb says, \"God comes to\nsee us without bell;\" that is, as there is no screen or ceiling between\nour heads and the infinite heavens, so is there no bar or wall in the\nsoul where man, the effect, ceases, and God, the cause, begins. The\nwalls are taken away. We lie open on one side to the deeps of spiritual\nnature, to the attributes of God. Justice we see and know, Love,\nFreedom, Power. These natures no man ever got above, but they tower over\nus, and most in the moment when our interests tempt us to wound them.\n\nThe sovereignty of this nature whereof we speak is made known by its\nindependency of those limitations which circumscribe us on every hand.\nThe soul circumscribes all things. As I have said, it contradicts all\nexperience. In like manner it abolishes time and space. The influence of\nthe senses has in most men overpowered the mind to that degree that the\nwalls of time and space have come to look real and insurmountable;\nand to speak with levity of these limits is, in the world, the sign of\ninsanity. Yet time and space are but inverse measures of the force of\nthe soul. The spirit sports with time,--\n\n          \"Can crowd eternity into an hour,\n           Or stretch an hour to eternity.\"\n\nWe are often made to feel that there is another youth and age than that\nwhich is measured from the year of our natural birth. Some thoughts\nalways find us young, and keep us so. Such a thought is the love of the\nuniversal and eternal beauty. Every man parts from that contemplation\nwith the feeling that it rather belongs to ages than to mortal life. The\nleast activity of the intellectual powers redeems us in a degree from\nthe conditions of time. In sickness, in languor, give us a strain of\npoetry or a profound sentence, and we are refreshed; or produce a volume\nof Plato or Shakspeare, or remind us of their names, and instantly\nwe come into a feeling of longevity. See how the deep divine thought\nreduces centuries and millenniums and makes itself present through all\nages. Is the teaching of Christ less effective now than it was when\nfirst his mouth was opened? The emphasis of facts and persons in my\nthought has nothing to do with time. And so always the soul's scale is\none, the scale of the senses and the understanding is another. Before\nthe revelations of the soul, Time, Space and Nature shrink away. In\ncommon speech we refer all things to time, as we habitually refer the\nimmensely sundered stars to one concave sphere. And so we say that the\nJudgment is distant or near, that the Millennium approaches, that a day\nof certain political, moral, social reforms is at hand, and the\nlike, when we mean that in the nature of things one of the facts we\ncontemplate is external and fugitive, and the other is permanent and\nconnate with the soul. The things we now esteem fixed shall, one by one,\ndetach themselves like ripe fruit from our experience, and fall. The\nwind shall blow them none knows whither. The landscape, the figures,\nBoston, London, are facts as fugitive as any institution past, or any\nwhiff of mist or smoke, and so is society, and so is the world. The soul\nlooketh steadily forwards, creating a world before her, leaving worlds\nbehind her. She has no dates, nor rites, nor persons, nor specialties\nnor men. The soul knows only the soul; the web of events is the flowing\nrobe in which she is clothed.\n\nAfter its own law and not by arithmetic is the rate of its progress to\nbe computed. The soul's advances are not made by gradation, such as can\nbe represented by motion in a straight line, but rather by ascension of\nstate, such as can be represented by metamorphosis,--from the egg to the\nworm, from the worm to the fly. The growths of genius are of a certain\ntotal character, that does not advance the elect individual first over\nJohn, then Adam, then Richard, and give to each the pain of discovered\ninferiority,--but by every throe of growth the man expands there where\nhe works, passing, at each pulsation, classes, populations, of men. With\neach divine impulse the mind rends the thin rinds of the visible and\nfinite, and comes out into eternity, and inspires and expires its air.\nIt converses with truths that have always been spoken in the world, and\nbecomes conscious of a closer sympathy with Zeno and Arrian than with\npersons in the house.\n\nThis is the law of moral and of mental gain. The simple rise as by\nspecific levity not into a particular virtue, but into the region of all\nthe virtues. They are in the spirit which contains them all. The soul\nrequires purity, but purity is not it; requires justice, but justice is\nnot that; requires beneficence, but is somewhat better; so that there is\na kind of descent and accommodation felt when we leave speaking of moral\nnature to urge a virtue which it enjoins. To the well-born child all the\nvirtues are natural, and not painfully acquired. Speak to his heart, and\nthe man becomes suddenly virtuous.\n\nWithin the same sentiment is the germ of intellectual growth, which\nobeys the same law. Those who are capable of humility, of justice,\nof love, of aspiration, stand already on a platform that commands the\nsciences and arts, speech and poetry, action and grace. For whoso dwells\nin this moral beatitude already anticipates those special powers which\nmen prize so highly. The lover has no talent, no skill, which passes for\nquite nothing with his enamoured maiden, however little she may possess\nof related faculty; and the heart which abandons itself to the Supreme\nMind finds itself related to all its works, and will travel a royal road\nto particular knowledges and powers. In ascending to this primary\nand aboriginal sentiment we have come from our remote station on the\ncircumference instantaneously to the centre of the world, where, as in\nthe closet of God, we see causes, and anticipate the universe, which is\nbut a slow effect.\n\nOne mode of the divine teaching is the incarnation of the spirit in a\nform,--in forms, like my own. I live in society, with persons who answer\nto thoughts in my own mind, or express a certain obedience to the great\ninstincts to which I live. I see its presence to them. I am certified of\na common nature; and these other souls, these separated selves, draw me\nas nothing else can. They stir in me the new emotions we call passion;\nof love, hatred, fear, admiration, pity; thence come conversation,\ncompetition, persuasion, cities and war. Persons are supplementary\nto the primary teaching of the soul. In youth we are mad for persons.\nChildhood and youth see all the world in them. But the larger experience\nof man discovers the identical nature appearing through them all.\nPersons themselves acquaint us with the impersonal. In all conversation\nbetween two persons tacit reference is made, as to a third party, to a\ncommon nature. That third party or common nature is not social; it\nis impersonal; is God. And so in groups where debate is earnest, and\nespecially on high questions, the company become aware that the thought\nrises to an equal level in all bosoms, that all have a spiritual\nproperty in what was said, as well as the sayer. They all become wiser\nthan they were. It arches over them like a temple, this unity of thought\nin which every heart beats with nobler sense of power and duty, and\nthinks and acts with unusual solemnity. All are conscious of attaining\nto a higher self-possession. It shines for all. There is a certain\nwisdom of humanity which is common to the greatest men with the lowest,\nand which our ordinary education often labors to silence and obstruct.\nThe mind is one, and the best minds, who love truth for its own\nsake, think much less of property in truth. They accept it thankfully\neverywhere, and do not label or stamp it with any man's name, for it is\ntheirs long beforehand, and from eternity. The learned and the studious\nof thought have no monopoly of wisdom. Their violence of direction\nin some degree disqualifies them to think truly. We owe many valuable\nobservations to people who are not very acute or profound, and who say\nthe thing without effort which we want and have long been hunting in\nvain. The action of the soul is oftener in that which is felt and left\nunsaid than in that which is said in any conversation. It broods over\nevery society, and they unconsciously seek for it in each other. We know\nbetter than we do. We do not yet possess ourselves, and we know at the\nsame time that we are much more. I feel the same truth how often in my\ntrivial conversation with my neighbors, that somewhat higher in each of\nus overlooks this by-play, and Jove nods to Jove from behind each of us.\n\nMen descend to meet. In their habitual and mean service to the world,\nfor which they forsake their native nobleness, they resemble those\nArabian sheiks who dwell in mean houses and affect an external poverty,\nto escape the rapacity of the Pacha, and reserve all their display of\nwealth for their interior and guarded retirements.\n\nAs it is present in all persons, so it is in every period of life. It is\nadult already in the infant man. In my dealing with my child, my Latin\nand Greek, my accomplishments and my money stead me nothing; but as much\nsoul as I have avails. If I am wilful, he sets his will against mine,\none for one, and leaves me, if I please, the degradation of beating him\nby my superiority of strength. But if I renounce my will and act for the\nsoul, setting that up as umpire between us two, out of his young eyes\nlooks the same soul; he reveres and loves with me.\n\nThe soul is the perceiver and revealer of truth. We know truth when we\nsee it, let skeptic and scoffer say what they choose. Foolish people\nask you, when you have spoken what they do not wish to hear, 'How do you\nknow it is truth, and not an error of your own?' We know truth when we\nsee it, from opinion, as we know when we are awake that we are awake. It\nwas a grand sentence of Emanuel Swedenborg, which would alone indicate\nthe greatness of that man's perception,--\"It is no proof of a man's\nunderstanding to be able to confirm whatever he pleases; but to be\nable to discern that what is true is true, and that what is false is\nfalse,--this is the mark and character of intelligence.\" In the book I\nread, the good thought returns to me, as every truth will, the image\nof the whole soul. To the bad thought which I find in it, the same soul\nbecomes a discerning, separating sword, and lops it away. We are wiser\nthan we know. If we will not interfere with our thought, but will act\nentirely, or see how the thing stands in God, we know the particular\nthing, and every thing, and every man. For the Maker of all things and\nall persons stands behind us and casts his dread omniscience through us\nover things.\n\nBut beyond this recognition of its own in particular passages of the\nindividual's experience, it also reveals truth. And here we should\nseek to reinforce ourselves by its very presence, and to speak with a\nworthier, loftier strain of that advent. For the soul's communication\nof truth is the highest event in nature, since it then does not give\nsomewhat from itself, but it gives itself, or passes into and becomes\nthat man whom it enlightens; or, in proportion to that truth he\nreceives, it takes him to itself.\n\nWe distinguish the announcements of the soul, its manifestations of its\nown nature, by the term Revelation. These are always attended by the\nemotion of the sublime. For this communication is an influx of the\nDivine mind into our mind. It is an ebb of the individual rivulet before\nthe flowing surges of the sea of life. Every distinct apprehension of\nthis central commandment agitates men with awe and delight. A thrill\npasses through all men at the reception of new truth, or at the\nperformance of a great action, which comes out of the heart of nature.\nIn these communications the power to see is not separated from the\nwill to do, but the insight proceeds from obedience, and the obedience\nproceeds from a joyful perception. Every moment when the individual\nfeels himself invaded by it is memorable. By the necessity of our\nconstitution a certain enthusiasm attends the individual's consciousness\nof that divine presence. The character and duration of this enthusiasm\nvaries with the state of the individual, from an ecstasy and trance and\nprophetic inspiration,--which is its rarer appearance,--to the faintest\nglow of virtuous emotion, in which form it warms, like our household\nfires, all the families and associations of men, and makes society\npossible. A certain tendency to insanity has always attended the opening\nof the religious sense in men, as if they had been \"blasted with excess\nof light.\" The trances of Socrates, the \"union\" of Plotinus, the\nvision of Porphyry, the conversion of Paul, the aurora of Behmen,\nthe convulsions of George Fox and his Quakers, the illumination of\nSwedenborg, are of this kind. What was in the case of these remarkable\npersons a ravishment, has, in innumerable instances in common life, been\nexhibited in less striking manner. Everywhere the history of religion\nbetrays a tendency to enthusiasm. The rapture of the Moravian and\nQuietist; the opening of the internal sense of the Word, in the language\nof the New Jerusalem Church; the revival of the Calvinistic churches;\nthe experiences of the Methodists, are varying forms of that shudder of\nawe and delight with which the individual soul always mingles with the\nuniversal soul.\n\nThe nature of these revelations is the same; they are perceptions of the\nabsolute law. They are solutions of the soul's own questions. They do\nnot answer the questions which the understanding asks. The soul answers\nnever by words, but by the thing itself that is inquired after.\n\nRevelation is the disclosure of the soul. The popular notion of a\nrevelation is that it is a telling of fortunes. In past oracles of the\nsoul the understanding seeks to find answers to sensual questions, and\nundertakes to tell from God how long men shall exist, what their hands\nshall do and who shall be their company, adding names and dates and\nplaces. But we must pick no locks. We must check this low curiosity. An\nanswer in words is delusive; it is really no answer to the questions\nyou ask. Do not require a description of the countries towards which you\nsail. The description does not describe them to you, and to-morrow you\narrive there and know them by inhabiting them. Men ask concerning the\nimmortality of the soul, the employments of heaven, the state of the\nsinner, and so forth. They even dream that Jesus has left replies to\nprecisely these interrogatories. Never a moment did that sublime spirit\nspeak in their patois. To truth, justice, love, the attributes of the\nsoul, the idea of immutableness is essentially associated. Jesus, living\nin these moral sentiments, heedless of sensual fortunes, heeding only\nthe manifestations of these, never made the separation of the idea of\nduration from the essence of these attributes, nor uttered a syllable\nconcerning the duration of the soul. It was left to his disciples to\nsever duration from the moral elements, and to teach the immortality\nof the soul as a doctrine, and maintain it by evidences. The moment the\ndoctrine of the immortality is separately taught, man is already fallen.\nIn the flowing of love, in the adoration of humility, there is no\nquestion of continuance. No inspired man ever asks this question or\ncondescends to these evidences. For the soul is true to itself, and the\nman in whom it is shed abroad cannot wander from the present, which is\ninfinite, to a future which would be finite.\n\nThese questions which we lust to ask about the future are a confession\nof sin. God has no answer for them. No answer in words can reply to a\nquestion of things. It is not in an arbitrary \"decree of God,\" but in\nthe nature of man, that a veil shuts down on the facts of to-morrow; for\nthe soul will not have us read any other cipher than that of cause and\neffect. By this veil which curtains events it instructs the children\nof men to live in to-day. The only mode of obtaining an answer to these\nquestions of the senses is to forego all low curiosity, and, accepting\nthe tide of being which floats us into the secret of nature, work and\nlive, work and live, and all unawares the advancing soul has built and\nforged for itself a new condition, and the question and the answer are\none.\n\nBy the same fire, vital, consecrating, celestial, which burns until\nit shall dissolve all things into the waves and surges of an ocean of\nlight, we see and know each other, and what spirit each is of. Who\ncan tell the grounds of his knowledge of the character of the several\nindividuals in his circle of friends? No man. Yet their acts and words\ndo not disappoint him. In that man, though he knew no ill of him, he put\nno trust. In that other, though they had seldom met, authentic signs\nhad yet passed, to signify that he might be trusted as one who had an\ninterest in his own character. We know each other very well,--which of\nus has been just to himself and whether that which we teach or behold is\nonly an aspiration or is our honest effort also.\n\nWe are all discerners of spirits. That diagnosis lies aloft in our\nlife or unconscious power. The intercourse of society, its trade,\nits religion, its friendships, its quarrels, is one wide, judicial\ninvestigation of character. In full court, or in small committee, or\nconfronted face to face, accuser and accused, men offer themselves to be\njudged. Against their will they exhibit those decisive trifles by which\ncharacter is read. But who judges? and what? Not our understanding. We\ndo not read them by learning or craft. No; the wisdom of the wise\nman consists herein, that he does not judge them; he lets them judge\nthemselves and merely reads and records their own verdict.\n\nBy virtue of this inevitable nature, private will is overpowered, and,\nmaugre our efforts or our imperfections, your genius will speak\nfrom you, and mine from me. That which we are, we shall teach, not\nvoluntarily but involuntarily. Thoughts come into our minds by avenues\nwhich we never left open, and thoughts go out of our minds through\navenues which we never voluntarily opened. Character teaches over our\nhead. The infallible index of true progress is found in the tone the man\ntakes. Neither his age, nor his breeding, nor company, nor books,\nnor actions, nor talents, nor all together can hinder him from being\ndeferential to a higher spirit than his own. If he have not found\nhis home in God, his manners, his forms of speech, the turn of\nhis sentences, the build, shall I say, of all his opinions will\ninvoluntarily confess it, let him brave it out how he will. If he have\nfound his centre, the Deity will shine through him, through all\nthe disguises of ignorance, of ungenial temperament, of unfavorable\ncircumstance. The tone of seeking is one, and the tone of having is\nanother.\n\nThe great distinction between teachers sacred or literary,--between\npoets like Herbert, and poets like Pope,--between philosophers like\nSpinoza, Kant and Coleridge, and philosophers like Locke, Paley,\nMackintosh and Stewart,--between men of the world who are reckoned\naccomplished talkers, and here and there a fervent mystic, prophesying\nhalf insane under the infinitude of his thought,--is that one class\nspeak from within, or from experience, as parties and possessors of the\nfact; and the other class from without, as spectators merely, or perhaps\nas acquainted with the fact on the evidence of third persons. It is of\nno use to preach to me from without. I can do that too easily myself.\nJesus speaks always from within, and in a degree that transcends all\nothers. In that is the miracle. I believe beforehand that it ought so\nto be. All men stand continually in the expectation of the appearance\nof such a teacher. But if a man do not speak from within the veil, where\nthe word is one with that it tells of, let him lowly confess it.\n\nThe same Omniscience flows into the intellect, and makes what we call\ngenius. Much of the wisdom of the world is not wisdom, and the most\nilluminated class of men are no doubt superior to literary fame, and\nare not writers. Among the multitude of scholars and authors, we feel no\nhallowing presence; we are sensible of a knack and skill rather than of\ninspiration; they have a light and know not whence it comes and call\nit their own; their talent is some exaggerated faculty, some overgrown\nmember, so that their strength is a disease. In these instances the\nintellectual gifts do not make the impression of virtue, but almost\nof vice; and we feel that a man's talents stand in the way of his\nadvancement in truth. But genius is religious. It is a larger imbibing\nof the common heart. It is not anomalous, but more like and not less\nlike other men. There is in all great poets a wisdom of humanity which\nis superior to any talents they exercise. The author, the wit, the\npartisan, the fine gentleman, does not take place of the man. Humanity\nshines in Homer, in Chaucer, in Spenser, in Shakspeare, in Milton. They\nare content with truth. They use the positive degree. They seem frigid\nand phlegmatic to those who have been spiced with the frantic passion\nand violent coloring of inferior but popular writers. For they are poets\nby the free course which they allow to the informing soul, which through\ntheir eyes beholds again and blesses the things which it hath made.\nThe soul is superior to its knowledge, wiser than any of its works. The\ngreat poet makes us feel our own wealth, and then we think less of\nhis compositions. His best communication to our mind is to teach us to\ndespise all he has done. Shakspeare carries us to such a lofty strain of\nintelligent activity as to suggest a wealth which beggars his own; and\nwe then feel that the splendid works which he has created, and which in\nother hours we extol as a sort of self-existent poetry, take no stronger\nhold of real nature than the shadow of a passing traveller on the rock.\nThe inspiration which uttered itself in Hamlet and Lear could utter\nthings as good from day to day for ever. Why then should I make account\nof Hamlet and Lear, as if we had not the soul from which they fell as\nsyllables from the tongue?\n\nThis energy does not descend into individual life on any other condition\nthan entire possession. It comes to the lowly and simple; it comes to\nwhomsoever will put off what is foreign and proud; it comes as insight;\nit comes as serenity and grandeur. When we see those whom it inhabits,\nwe are apprised of new degrees of greatness. From that inspiration the\nman comes back with a changed tone. He does not talk with men with an\neye to their opinion. He tries them. It requires of us to be plain and\ntrue. The vain traveller attempts to embellish his life by quoting my\nlord and the prince and the countess, who thus said or did to him.\nThe ambitious vulgar show you their spoons and brooches and rings, and\npreserve their cards and compliments. The more cultivated, in their\naccount of their own experience, cull out the pleasing, poetic\ncircumstance,--the visit to Rome, the man of genius they saw, the\nbrilliant friend They know; still further on perhaps the gorgeous\nlandscape, the mountain lights, the mountain thoughts they enjoyed\nyesterday,--and so seek to throw a romantic color over their life. But\nthe soul that ascends to worship the great God is plain and true; has no\nrose-color, no fine friends, no chivalry, no adventures; does not want\nadmiration; dwells in the hour that now is, in the earnest experience\nof the common day,--by reason of the present moment and the mere trifle\nhaving become porous to thought and bibulous of the sea of light.\n\nConverse with a mind that is grandly simple, and literature looks like\nword-catching. The simplest utterances are worthiest to be written, yet\nare they so cheap and so things of course, that in the infinite riches\nof the soul it is like gathering a few pebbles off the ground, or\nbottling a little air in a phial, when the whole earth and the whole\natmosphere are ours. Nothing can pass there, or make you one of the\ncircle, but the casting aside your trappings, and dealing man to man in\nnaked truth, plain confession, and omniscient affirmation.\n\nSouls such as these treat you as gods would, walk as gods in the earth,\naccepting without any admiration your wit, your bounty, your virtue\neven,--say rather your act of duty, for your virtue they own as their\nproper blood, royal as themselves, and over-royal, and the father of the\ngods. But what rebuke their plain fraternal bearing casts on the mutual\nflattery with which authors solace each other and wound themselves!\nThese flatter not. I do not wonder that these men go to see Cromwell and\nChristina and Charles the Second and James the First and the Grand Turk.\nFor they are, in their own elevation, the fellows of kings, and must\nfeel the servile tone of conversation in the world. They must always be\na godsend to princes, for they confront them, a king to a king, without\nducking or concession, and give a high nature the refreshment and\nsatisfaction of resistance, of plain humanity, of even companionship and\nof new ideas. They leave them wiser and superior men. Souls like these\nmake us feel that sincerity is more excellent than flattery. Deal so\nplainly with man and woman as to constrain the utmost sincerity and\ndestroy all hope of trifling with you. It is the highest compliment you\ncan pay. Their \"highest praising,\" said Milton, \"is not flattery, and\ntheir plainest advice is a kind of praising.\"\n\nIneffable is the union of man and God in every act of the soul. The\nsimplest person who in his integrity worships God, becomes God; yet for\never and ever the influx of this better and universal self is new and\nunsearchable. It inspires awe and astonishment. How dear, how soothing\nto man, arises the idea of God, peopling the lonely place, effacing the\nscars of our mistakes and disappointments! When we have broken our god\nof tradition and ceased from our god of rhetoric, then may God fire the\nheart with his presence. It is the doubling of the heart itself, nay,\nthe infinite enlargement of the heart with a power of growth to a new\ninfinity on every side. It inspires in man an infallible trust. He has\nnot the conviction, but the sight, that the best is the true, and may in\nthat thought easily dismiss all particular uncertainties and fears,\nand adjourn to the sure revelation of time the solution of his private\nriddles. He is sure that his welfare is dear to the heart of being.\nIn the presence of law to his mind he is overflowed with a reliance so\nuniversal that it sweeps away all cherished hopes and the most stable\nprojects of mortal condition in its flood. He believes that he cannot\nescape from his good. The things that are really for thee gravitate to\nthee. You are running to seek your friend. Let your feet run, but your\nmind need not. If you do not find him, will you not acquiesce that it is\nbest you should not find him? for there is a power, which, as it is in\nyou, is in him also, and could therefore very well bring you together,\nif it were for the best. You are preparing with eagerness to go and\nrender a service to which your talent and your taste invite you, the\nlove of men and the hope of fame. Has it not occurred to you that you\nhave no right to go, unless you are equally willing to be prevented from\ngoing? O, believe, as thou livest, that every sound that is spoken over\nthe round world, which thou oughtest to hear, will vibrate on thine ear!\nEvery proverb, every book, every byword that belongs to thee for aid or\ncomfort, shall surely come home through open or winding passages. Every\nfriend whom not thy fantastic will but the great and tender heart in\nthee craveth, shall lock thee in his embrace. And this because the\nheart in thee is the heart of all; not a valve, not a wall, not\nan intersection is there anywhere in nature, but one blood rolls\nuninterruptedly an endless circulation through all men, as the water of\nthe globe is all one sea, and, truly seen, its tide is one.\n\nLet man then learn the revelation of all nature and all thought to his\nheart; this, namely; that the Highest dwells with him; that the sources\nof nature are in his own mind, if the sentiment of duty is there. But if\nhe would know what the great God speaketh, he must 'go into his closet\nand shut the door,' as Jesus said. God will not make himself manifest to\ncowards. He must greatly listen to himself, withdrawing himself from all\nthe accents of other men's devotion. Even their prayers are hurtful to\nhim, until he have made his own. Our religion vulgarly stands on\nnumbers of believers. Whenever the appeal is made,--no matter how\nindirectly,--to numbers, proclamation is then and there made that\nreligion is not. He that finds God a sweet enveloping thought to him\nnever counts his company. When I sit in that presence, who shall dare\nto come in? When I rest in perfect humility, when I burn with pure love,\nwhat can Calvin or Swedenborg say?\n\nIt makes no difference whether the appeal is to numbers or to one. The\nfaith that stands on authority is not faith. The reliance on authority\nmeasures the decline of religion, the withdrawal of the soul. The\nposition men have given to Jesus, now for many centuries of history, is\na position of authority. It characterizes themselves. It cannot alter\nthe eternal facts. Great is the soul, and plain. It is no flatterer,\nit is no follower; it never appeals from itself. It believes in itself.\nBefore the immense possibilities of man all mere experience, all past\nbiography, however spotless and sainted, shrinks away. Before that\nheaven which our presentiments foreshow us, we cannot easily praise any\nform of life we have seen or read of. We not only affirm that we have\nfew great men, but, absolutely speaking, that we have none; that we have\nno history, no record of any character or mode of living that entirely\ncontents us. The saints and demigods whom history worships we are\nconstrained to accept with a grain of allowance. Though in our lonely\nhours we draw a new strength out of their memory, yet, pressed on our\nattention, as they are by the thoughtless and customary, they fatigue\nand invade. The soul gives itself, alone, original and pure, to the\nLonely, Original and Pure, who, on that condition, gladly inhabits,\nleads and speaks through it. Then is it glad, young and nimble. It is\nnot wise, but it sees through all things. It is not called religious,\nbut it is innocent. It calls the light its own, and feels that the grass\ngrows and the stone falls by a law inferior to, and dependent on, its\nnature. Behold, it saith, I am born into the great, the universal mind.\nI, the imperfect, adore my own Perfect. I am somehow receptive of the\ngreat soul, and thereby I do Overlook the sun and the stars and feel\nthem to be the fair accidents and effects which change and pass. More\nand more the surges of everlasting nature enter into me, and I become\npublic and human in my regards and actions. So come I to live in\nthoughts and act with energies which are immortal. Thus revering the\nsoul, and learning, as the ancient said, that \"its beauty is immense,\"\nman will come to see that the world is the perennial miracle which the\nsoul worketh, and be less astonished at particular wonders; he will\nlearn that there is no profane history; that all history is sacred; that\nthe universe is represented in an atom, in a moment of time. He will\nweave no longer a spotted life of shreds and patches, but he will live\nwith a divine unity. He will cease from what is base and frivolous in\nhis life and be content with all places and with any service he can\nrender. He will calmly front the morrow in the negligency of that trust\nwhich carries God with it and so hath already the whole future in the\nbottom of the heart.\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\n     CIRCLES.\n\n     NATURE centres into balls,\n     And her proud ephemerals,\n     Fast to surface and outside,\n     Scan the profile of the sphere;\n     Knew they what that signified,\n     A new genesis were here.\n\n\n\n\nX. CIRCLES.\n\nThe eye is the first circle; the horizon which it forms is the second;\nand throughout nature this primary figure is repeated without end. It is\nthe highest emblem in the cipher of the world. St. Augustine described\nthe nature of God as a circle whose centre was everywhere and its\ncircumference nowhere. We are all our lifetime reading the copious\nsense of this first of forms. One moral we have already deduced, in\nconsidering the circular or compensatory character of every human\naction. Another analogy we shall now trace, that every action admits of\nbeing outdone. Our life is an apprenticeship to the truth that around\nevery circle another can be drawn; that there is no end in nature, but\nevery end is a beginning; that there is always another dawn risen on\nmid-noon, and under every deep a lower deep opens.\n\nThis fact, as far as it symbolizes the moral fact of the Unattainable,\nthe flying Perfect, around which the hands of man can never meet, at\nonce the inspirer and the condemner of every success, may conveniently\nserve us to connect many illustrations of human power in every\ndepartment.\n\nThere are no fixtures in nature. The universe is fluid and volatile.\nPermanence is but a word of degrees. Our globe seen by God is a\ntransparent law, not a mass of facts. The law dissolves the fact and\nholds it fluid. Our culture is the predominance of an idea which draws\nafter it this train of cities and institutions. Let us rise into another\nidea: they will disappear. The Greek sculpture is all melted away, as if\nit had been statues of ice; here and there a solitary figure or fragment\nremaining, as we see flecks and scraps of snow left in cold dells and\nmountain clefts in June and July. For the genius that created it creates\nnow somewhat else. The Greek letters last a little longer, but are\nalready passing under the same sentence and tumbling into the inevitable\npit which the creation of new thought opens for all that is old. The new\ncontinents are built out of the ruins of an old planet; the new races\nfed out of the decomposition of the foregoing. New arts destroy the old.\nSee the investment of capital in aqueducts made useless by hydraulics;\nfortifications, by gunpowder; roads and canals, by railways; sails, by\nsteam; steam by electricity.\n\nYou admire this tower of granite, weathering the hurts of so many ages.\nYet a little waving hand built this huge wall, and that which builds is\nbetter than that which is built. The hand that built can topple it down\nmuch faster. Better than the hand and nimbler was the invisible thought\nwhich wrought through it; and thus ever, behind the coarse effect, is a\nfine cause, which, being narrowly seen, is itself the effect of a finer\ncause. Every thing looks permanent until its secret is known. A rich\nestate appears to women a firm and lasting fact; to a merchant, one\neasily created out of any materials, and easily lost. An orchard, good\ntillage, good grounds, seem a fixture, like a gold mine, or a river, to\na citizen; but to a large farmer, not much more fixed than the state\nof the crop. Nature looks provokingly stable and secular, but it has\na cause like all the rest; and when once I comprehend that, will these\nfields stretch so immovably wide, these leaves hang so individually\nconsiderable? Permanence is a word of degrees. Every thing is medial.\nMoons are no more bounds to spiritual power than bat-balls.\n\nThe key to every man is his thought. Sturdy and defying though he look,\nhe has a helm which he obeys, which is the idea after which all his\nfacts are classified. He can only be reformed by showing him a new\nidea which commands his own. The life of man is a self-evolving circle,\nwhich, from a ring imperceptibly small, rushes on all sides outwards to\nnew and larger circles, and that without end. The extent to which this\ngeneration of circles, wheel without wheel, will go, depends on the\nforce or truth of the individual soul. For it is the inert effort\nof each thought, having formed itself into a circular wave of\ncircumstance,--as for instance an empire, rules of an art, a local\nusage, a religious rite,--to heap itself on that ridge and to solidify\nand hem in the life. But if the soul is quick and strong it bursts over\nthat boundary on all sides and expands another orbit on the great deep,\nwhich also runs up into a high wave, with attempt again to stop and to\nbind. But the heart refuses to be imprisoned; in its first and narrowest\npulses, it already tends outward with a vast force and to immense and\ninnumerable expansions.\n\nEvery ultimate fact is only the first of a new series. Every general law\nonly a particular fact of some more general law presently to disclose\nitself. There is no outside, no inclosing wall, no circumference to us.\nThe man finishes his story,--how good! how final! how it puts a new face\non all things! He fills the sky. Lo! on the other side rises also a man\nand draws a circle around the circle we had just pronounced the outline\nof the sphere. Then already is our first speaker not man, but only a\nfirst speaker. His only redress is forthwith to draw a circle outside of\nhis antagonist. And so men do by themselves. The result of to-day, which\nhaunts the mind and cannot be escaped, will presently be abridged into\na word, and the principle that seemed to explain nature will itself be\nincluded as one example of a bolder generalization. In the thought of\nto-morrow there is a power to upheave all thy creed, all the creeds, all\nthe literatures of the nations, and marshal thee to a heaven which no\nepic dream has yet depicted. Every man is not so much a workman in the\nworld as he is a suggestion of that he should be. Men walk as prophecies\nof the next age.\n\nStep by step we scale this mysterious ladder: the steps are actions; the\nnew prospect is power. Every several result is threatened and judged by\nthat which follows. Every one seems to be contradicted by the new; it is\nonly limited by the new. The new statement is always hated by the old,\nand, to those dwelling in the old, comes like an abyss of scepticism.\nBut the eye soon gets wonted to it, for the eye and it are effects of\none cause; then its innocency and benefit appear, and presently, all\nits energy spent, it pales and dwindles before the revelation of the new\nhour.\n\nFear not the new generalization. Does the fact look crass and material,\nthreatening to degrade thy theory of spirit? Resist it not; it goes to\nrefine and raise thy theory of matter just as much.\n\nThere are no fixtures to men, if we appeal to consciousness. Every man\nsupposes himself not to be fully understood; and if there is any truth\nin him, if he rests at last on the divine soul, I see not how it can\nbe otherwise. The last chamber, the last closet, he must feel was never\nopened; there is always a residuum unknown, unanalyzable. That is, every\nman believes that he has a greater possibility.\n\nOur moods do not believe in each other. To-day I am full of thoughts and\ncan write what I please. I see no reason why I should not have the same\nthought, the same power of expression, to-morrow. What I write, whilst I\nwrite it, seems the most natural thing in the world; but yesterday I\nsaw a dreary vacuity in this direction in which now I see so much; and\na month hence, I doubt not, I shall wonder who he was that wrote so many\ncontinuous pages. Alas for this infirm faith, this will not strenuous,\nthis vast ebb of a vast flow! I am God in nature; I am a weed by the\nwall.\n\nThe continual effort to raise himself above himself, to work a pitch\nabove his last height, betrays itself in a man's relations. We thirst\nfor approbation, yet cannot forgive the approver. The sweet of nature\nis love; yet, if I have a friend I am tormented by my imperfections. The\nlove of me accuses the other party. If he were high enough to slight me,\nthen could I love him, and rise by my affection to new heights. A man's\ngrowth is seen in the successive choirs of his friends. For every friend\nwhom he loses for truth, he gains a better. I thought as I walked in the\nwoods and mused on my friends, why should I play with them this game\nof idolatry? I know and see too well, when not voluntarily blind, the\nspeedy limits of persons called high and worthy. Rich, noble and great\nthey are by the liberality of our speech, but truth is sad. O blessed\nSpirit, whom I forsake for these, they are not thou! Every personal\nconsideration that we allow costs us heavenly state. We sell the thrones\nof angels for a short and turbulent pleasure.\n\nHow often must we learn this lesson? Men cease to interest us when we\nfind their limitations. The only sin is limitation. As soon as you\nonce come up with a man's limitations, it is all over with him. Has he\ntalents? has he enterprise? has he knowledge? It boots not. Infinitely\nalluring and attractive was he to you yesterday, a great hope, a sea to\nswim in; now, you have found his shores, found it a pond, and you care\nnot if you never see it again.\n\nEach new step we take in thought reconciles twenty seemingly discordant\nfacts, as expressions of one law. Aristotle and Plato are reckoned the\nrespective heads of two schools. A wise man will see that Aristotle\nplatonizes. By going one step farther back in thought, discordant\nopinions are reconciled by being seen to be two extremes of one\nprinciple, and we can never go so far back as to preclude a still higher\nvision.\n\nBeware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this planet. Then all\nthings are at risk. It is as when a conflagration has broken out in a\ngreat city, and no man knows what is safe, or where it will end. There\nis not a piece of science but its flank may be turned to-morrow; there\nis not any literary reputation, not the so-called eternal names of\nfame, that may not be revised and condemned. The very hopes of man, the\nthoughts of his heart, the religion of nations, the manners and morals\nof mankind are all at the mercy of a new generalization. Generalization\nis always a new influx of the divinity into the mind. Hence the thrill\nthat attends it.\n\nValor consists in the power of self-recovery, so that a man cannot have\nhis flank turned, cannot be out-generalled, but put him where you\nwill, he stands. This can only be by his preferring truth to his past\napprehension of truth, and his alert acceptance of it from whatever\nquarter; the intrepid conviction that his laws, his relations to\nsociety, his Christianity, his world, may at any time be superseded and\ndecease.\n\nThere are degrees in idealism. We learn first to play with it\nacademically, as the magnet was once a toy. Then we see in the heyday\nof youth and poetry that it may be true, that it is true in gleams and\nfragments. Then its countenance waxes stern and grand, and we see that\nit must be true. It now shows itself ethical and practical. We learn\nthat God is; that he is in me; and that all things are shadows of him.\nThe idealism of Berkeley is only a crude statement of the idealism of\nJesus, and that again is a crude statement of the fact that all nature\nis the rapid efflux of goodness executing and organizing itself. Much\nmore obviously is history and the state of the world at any one time\ndirectly dependent on the intellectual classification then existing in\nthe minds of men. The things which are dear to men at this hour are so\non account of the ideas which have emerged on their mental horizon, and\nwhich cause the present order of things, as a tree bears its apples. A\nnew degree of culture would instantly revolutionize the entire system of\nhuman pursuits.\n\nConversation is a game of circles. In conversation we pluck up the\ntermini which bound the common of silence on every side. The parties are\nnot to be judged by the spirit they partake and even express under this\nPentecost. To-morrow they will have receded from this high-water mark.\nTo-morrow you shall find them stooping under the old pack-saddles. Yet\nlet us enjoy the cloven flame whilst it glows on our walls. When each\nnew speaker strikes a new light, emancipates us from the oppression of\nthe last speaker, to oppress us with the greatness and exclusiveness of\nhis own thought, then yields us to another redeemer, we seem to recover\nour rights, to become men. O, what truths profound and executable only\nin ages and orbs, are supposed in the announcement of every truth! In\ncommon hours, society sits cold and statuesque. We all stand waiting,\nempty,--knowing, possibly, that we can be full, surrounded by mighty\nsymbols which are not symbols to us, but prose and trivial toys. Then\ncometh the god and converts the statues into fiery men, and by a flash\nof his eye burns up the veil which shrouded all things, and the meaning\nof the very furniture, of cup and saucer, of chair and clock and\ntester, is manifest. The facts which loomed so large in the fogs of\nyesterday,--property, climate, breeding, personal beauty and the like,\nhave strangely changed their proportions. All that we reckoned settled\nshakes and rattles; and literatures, cities, climates, religions, leave\ntheir foundations and dance before our eyes. And yet here again see\nthe swift circumspection! Good as is discourse, silence is better, and\nshames it. The length of the discourse indicates the distance of\nthought betwixt the speaker and the hearer. If they were at a perfect\nunderstanding in any part, no words would be necessary thereon. If at\none in all parts, no words would be suffered.\n\nLiterature is a point outside of our hodiernal circle through which\na new one may be described. The use of literature is to afford us a\nplatform whence we may command a view of our present life, a purchase by\nwhich we may move it. We fill ourselves with ancient learning, install\nourselves the best we can in Greek, in Punic, in Roman houses, only that\nwe may wiselier see French, English and American houses and modes of\nliving. In like manner we see literature best from the midst of wild\nnature, or from the din of affairs, or from a high religion. The field\ncannot be well seen from within the field. The astronomer must have\nhis diameter of the earth's orbit as a base to find the parallax of any\nstar.\n\nTherefore we value the poet. All the argument and all the wisdom is not\nin the encyclopaedia, or the treatise on metaphysics, or the Body of\nDivinity, but in the sonnet or the play. In my daily work I incline to\nrepeat my old steps, and do not believe in remedial force, in the power\nof change and reform. But some Petrarch or Ariosto, filled with the new\nwine of his imagination, writes me an ode or a brisk romance, full of\ndaring thought and action. He smites and arouses me with his shrill\ntones, breaks up my whole chain of habits, and I open my eye on my own\npossibilities. He claps wings to the sides of all the solid old lumber\nof the world, and I am capable once more of choosing a straight path in\ntheory and practice.\n\nWe have the same need to command a view of the religion of the world. We\ncan never see Christianity from the catechism:--from the pastures, from\na boat in the pond, from amidst the songs of wood-birds we possibly\nmay. Cleansed by the elemental light and wind, steeped in the sea of\nbeautiful forms which the field offers us, we may chance to cast a right\nglance back upon biography. Christianity is rightly dear to the best\nof mankind; yet was there never a young philosopher whose breeding had\nfallen into the Christian church by whom that brave text of Paul's was\nnot specially prized:--\"Then shall also the Son be subject unto Him who\nput all things under him, that God may be all in all.\" Let the claims\nand virtues of persons be never so great and welcome, the instinct of\nman presses eagerly onward to the impersonal and illimitable, and gladly\narms itself against the dogmatism of bigots with this generous word out\nof the book itself.\n\nThe natural world may be conceived of as a system of concentric circles,\nand we now and then detect in nature slight dislocations which apprise\nus that this surface on which we now stand is not fixed, but sliding.\nThese manifold tenacious qualities, this chemistry and vegetation, these\nmetals and animals, which seem to stand there for their own sake, are\nmeans and methods only,--are words of God, and as fugitive as other\nwords. Has the naturalist or chemist learned his craft, who has explored\nthe gravity of atoms and the elective affinities, who has not yet\ndiscerned the deeper law whereof this is only a partial or approximate\nstatement, namely that like draws to like, and that the goods which\nbelong to you gravitate to you and need not be pursued with pains\nand cost? Yet is that statement approximate also, and not final.\nOmnipresence is a higher fact. Not through subtle subterranean channels\nneed friend and fact be drawn to their counterpart, but, rightly\nconsidered, these things proceed from the eternal generation of the\nsoul. Cause and effect are two sides of one fact.\n\nThe same law of eternal procession ranges all that we call the virtues,\nand extinguishes each in the light of a better. The great man will\nnot be prudent in the popular sense; all his prudence will be so much\ndeduction from his grandeur. But it behooves each to see, when he\nsacrifices prudence, to what god he devotes it; if to ease and pleasure,\nhe had better be prudent still; if to a great trust, he can well spare\nhis mule and panniers who has a winged chariot instead. Geoffrey draws\non his boots to go through the woods, that his feet may be safer from\nthe bite of snakes; Aaron never thinks of such a peril. In many years\nneither is harmed by such an accident. Yet it seems to me that with\nevery precaution you take against such an evil you put yourself into\nthe power of the evil. I suppose that the highest prudence is the lowest\nprudence. Is this too sudden a rushing from the centre to the verge\nof our orbit? Think how many times we shall fall back into pitiful\ncalculations before we take up our rest in the great sentiment, or make\nthe verge of to-day the new centre. Besides, your bravest sentiment is\nfamiliar to the humblest men. The poor and the low have their way of\nexpressing the last facts of philosophy as well as you. \"Blessed be\nnothing\" and \"The worse things are, the better they are\" are proverbs\nwhich express the transcendentalism of common life.\n\nOne man's justice is another's injustice; one man's beauty another's\nugliness; one man's wisdom another's folly; as one beholds the same\nobjects from a higher point. One man thinks justice consists in paying\ndebts, and has no measure in his abhorrence of another who is very\nremiss in this duty and makes the creditor wait tediously. But that\nsecond man has his own way of looking at things; asks himself Which debt\nmust I pay first, the debt to the rich, or the debt to the poor? the\ndebt of money, or the debt of thought to mankind, of genius to nature?\nFor you, O broker, there is no other principle but arithmetic. For me,\ncommerce is of trivial import; love, faith, truth of character, the\naspiration of man, these are sacred; nor can I detach one duty, like\nyou, from all other duties, and concentrate my forces mechanically on\nthe payment of moneys. Let me live onward; you shall find that, though\nslower, the progress of my character will liquidate all these debts\nwithout injustice to higher claims. If a man should dedicate himself to\nthe payment of notes, would not this be injustice? Does he owe no debt\nbut money? And are all claims on him to be postponed to a landlord's or\na banker's?\n\nThere is no virtue which is final; all are initial. The virtues of\nsociety are vices of the saint. The terror of reform is the discovery\nthat we must cast away our virtues, or what we have always esteemed\nsuch, into the same pit that has consumed our grosser vices:--\n\n          \"Forgive his crimes, forgive his virtues too,\n           Those smaller faults, half converts to the right.\"\n\nIt is the highest power of divine moments that they abolish our\ncontritions also. I accuse myself of sloth and unprofitableness day by\nday; but when these waves of God flow into me I no longer reckon lost\ntime. I no longer poorly compute my possible achievement by what remains\nto me of the month or the year; for these moments confer a sort of\nomnipresence and omnipotence which asks nothing of duration, but sees\nthat the energy of the mind is commensurate with the work to be done,\nwithout time.\n\nAnd thus, O circular philosopher, I hear some reader exclaim, you have\narrived at a fine Pyrrhonism, at an equivalence and indifferency of\nall actions, and would fain teach us that if we are true, forsooth, our\ncrimes may be lively stones out of which we shall construct the temple\nof the true God!\n\nI am not careful to justify myself. I own I am gladdened by seeing the\npredominance of the saccharine principle throughout vegetable nature,\nand not less by beholding in morals that unrestrained inundation of the\nprinciple of good into every chink and hole that selfishness has left\nopen, yea into selfishness and sin itself; so that no evil is pure, nor\nhell itself without its extreme satisfactions. But lest I should mislead\nany when I have my own head and obey my whims, let me remind the reader\nthat I am only an experimenter. Do not set the least value on what I do,\nor the least discredit on what I do not, as if I pretended to settle\nany thing as true or false. I unsettle all things. No facts are to me\nsacred; none are profane; I simply experiment, an endless seeker with no\nPast at my back.\n\nYet this incessant movement and progression which all things partake\ncould never become sensible to us but by contrast to some principle\nof fixture or stability in the soul. Whilst the eternal generation of\ncircles proceeds, the eternal generator abides. That central life is\nsomewhat superior to creation, superior to knowledge and thought,\nand contains all its circles. For ever it labors to create a life and\nthought as Large and excellent as itself, but in vain, for that which is\nmade instructs how to make a better.\n\nThus there is no sleep, no pause, no preservation, but all things renew,\ngerminate and spring. Why should we import rags and relics into the new\nhour? Nature abhors the old, and old age seems the only disease;\nall others run into this one. We call it by many names,--fever,\nintemperance, insanity, stupidity and crime; they are all forms of old\nage; they are rest, conservatism, appropriation, inertia; not newness,\nnot the way onward. We grizzle every day. I see no need of it. Whilst\nwe converse with what is above us, we do not grow old, but grow young.\nInfancy, youth, receptive, aspiring, with religious eye looking upward,\ncounts itself nothing and abandons itself to the instruction flowing\nfrom all sides. But the man and woman of seventy assume to know all,\nthey have outlived their hope, they renounce aspiration, accept the\nactual for the necessary and talk down to the young. Let them, then,\nbecome organs of the Holy Ghost; let them be lovers; let them behold\ntruth; and their eyes are uplifted, their wrinkles smoothed, they are\nperfumed again with hope and power. This old age ought not to creep on a\nhuman mind. In nature every moment is new; the past is always swallowed\nand forgotten; the coming only is sacred. Nothing is secure but life,\ntransition, the energizing spirit. No love can be bound by oath or\ncovenant to secure it against a higher love. No truth so sublime but it\nmay be trivial to-morrow in the light of new thoughts. People wish to be\nsettled; only as far as they are unsettled is there any hope for them.\n\nLife is a series of surprises. We do not guess to-day the mood, the\npleasure, the power of to-morrow, when we are building up our being. Of\nlower states, of acts of routine and sense, we can tell somewhat; but\nthe masterpieces of God, the total growths and universal movements of\nthe soul, he hideth; they are incalculable. I can know that truth is\ndivine and helpful; but how it shall help me I can have no guess, for so\nto be is the sole inlet of so to know. The new position of the advancing\nman has all the powers of the old, yet has them all new. It carries in\nits bosom all the energies of the past, yet is itself an exhalation\nof the morning. I cast away in this new moment all my once hoarded\nknowledge, as vacant and vain. Now, for the first time seem I to know\nany thing rightly. The simplest words,--we do not know what they mean\nexcept when we love and aspire.\n\nThe difference between talents and character is adroitness to keep the\nold and trodden round, and power and courage to make a new road to new\nand better goals. Character makes an overpowering present; a cheerful,\ndetermined hour, which fortifies all the company by making them see that\nmuch is possible and excellent that was not thought of. Character dulls\nthe impression of particular events. When we see the conqueror we do not\nthink much of any one battle or success. We see that we had exaggerated\nthe difficulty. It was easy to him. The great man is not convulsible or\ntormentable; events pass over him without much impression. People say\nsometimes, 'See what I have overcome; see how cheerful I am; see how\ncompletely I have triumphed over these black events.' Not if they still\nremind me of the black event. True conquest is the causing the calamity\nto fade and disappear as an early cloud of insignificant result in a\nhistory so large and advancing.\n\nThe one thing which we seek with insatiable desire is to forget\nourselves, to be surprised out of our propriety, to lose our sempiternal\nmemory and to do something without knowing how or why; in short to draw\na new circle. Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm. The\nway of life is wonderful; it is by abandonment. The great moments of\nhistory are the facilities of performance through the strength of ideas,\nas the works of genius and religion. \"A man,\" said Oliver Cromwell, \"never\nrises so high as when he knows not whither he is going.\" Dreams\nand drunkenness, the use of opium and alcohol are the semblance\nand counterfeit of this oracular genius, and hence their dangerous\nattraction for men. For the like reason they ask the aid of wild\npassions, as in gaming and war, to ape in some manner these flames and\ngenerosities of the heart.\n\n*****\n\n\n\n     INTELLECT.\n\n     GO, speed the stars of Thought\n     On to their shining goals;--\n     The sower scatters broad his seed,\n     The wheat thou strew'st be souls.\n\n\n\n\nXI. INTELLECT.\n\nEvery substance is negatively electric to that which stands above it\nin the chemical tables, positively to that which stands below it. Water\ndissolves wood and iron and salt; air dissolves water; electric fire\ndissolves air, but the intellect dissolves fire, gravity, laws,\nmethod, and the subtlest unnamed relations of nature in its\nresistless menstruum. Intellect lies behind genius, which is intellect\nconstructive. Intellect is the simple power anterior to all action or\nconstruction. Gladly would I unfold in calm degrees a natural history\nof the intellect, but what man has yet been able to mark the steps and\nboundaries of that transparent essence? The first questions are always\nto be asked, and the wisest doctor is gravelled by the inquisitiveness\nof a child. How can we speak of the action of the mind under any\ndivisions, as of its knowledge, of its ethics, of its works, and so\nforth, since it melts will into perception, knowledge into act? Each\nbecomes the other. Itself alone is. Its vision is not like the vision of\nthe eye, but is union with the things known.\n\nIntellect and intellection signify to the common ear consideration of\nabstract truth. The considerations of time and place, of you and me, of\nprofit and hurt tyrannize over most men's minds. Intellect separates the\nfact considered, from you, from all local and personal reference, and\ndiscerns it as if it existed for its own sake. Heraclitus looked upon\nthe affections as dense and colored mists. In the fog of good and\nevil affections it is hard for man to walk forward in a straight line.\nIntellect is void of affection and sees an object as it stands in the\nlight of science, cool and disengaged. The intellect goes out of the\nindividual, floats over its own personality, and regards it as a fact,\nand not as I and mine. He who is immersed in what concerns person or\nplace cannot see the problem of existence. This the intellect always\nponders. Nature shows all things formed and bound. The intellect pierces\nthe form, overleaps the wall, detects intrinsic likeness between remote\nthings and reduces all things into a few principles.\n\nThe making a fact the subject of thought raises it. All that mass of\nmental and moral phenomena which we do not make objects of voluntary\nthought, come within the power of fortune; they constitute the\ncircumstance of daily life; they are subject to change, to fear, and\nhope. Every man beholds his human condition with a degree of melancholy.\nAs a ship aground is battered by the waves, so man, imprisoned in mortal\nlife, lies open to the mercy of coming events. But a truth, separated by\nthe intellect, is no longer a subject of destiny. We behold it as a god\nupraised above care and fear. And so any fact in our life, or any\nrecord of our fancies or reflections, disentangled from the web of our\nunconsciousness, becomes an object impersonal and immortal. It is the\npast restored, but embalmed. A better art than that of Egypt has taken\nfear and corruption out of it. It is eviscerated of care. It is offered\nfor science. What is addressed to us for contemplation does not threaten\nus but makes us intellectual beings.\n\nThe growth of the intellect is spontaneous in every expansion. The mind\nthat grows could not predict the times, the means, the mode of that\nspontaneity. God enters by a private door into every individual. Long\nprior to the age of reflection is the thinking of the mind. Out of\ndarkness it came insensibly into the marvellous light of to-day. In the\nperiod of infancy it accepted and disposed of all impressions from the\nsurrounding creation after its own way. Whatever any mind doth or saith\nis after a law; and this native law remains over it after it has come to\nreflection or conscious thought. In the most worn, pedantic, introverted\nself-tormenter's life, the greatest part is incalculable by him,\nunforeseen, unimaginable, and must be, until he can take himself up by\nhis own ears. What am I? What has my will done to make me that I\nam? Nothing. I have been floated into this thought, this hour, this\nconnection of events, by secret currents of might and mind, and my\ningenuity and wilfulness have not thwarted, have not aided to an\nappreciable degree.\n\nOur spontaneous action is always the best. You cannot with your best\ndeliberation and heed come so close to any question as your spontaneous\nglance shall bring you, whilst you rise from your bed, or walk abroad\nin the morning after meditating the matter before sleep on the previous\nnight. Our thinking is a pious reception. Our truth of thought is\ntherefore vitiated as much by too violent direction given by our will,\nas by too great negligence. We do not determine what we will think.\nWe only open our senses, clear away as we can all obstruction from the\nfact, and suffer the intellect to see. We have little control over our\nthoughts. We are the prisoners of ideas. They catch us up for moments\ninto their heaven and so fully engage us that we take no thought for the\nmorrow, gaze like children, without an effort to make them our own. By\nand by we fall out of that rapture, bethink us where we have been, what\nwe have seen, and repeat as truly as we can what we have beheld. As\nfar as we can recall these ecstasies we carry away in the ineffaceable\nmemory the result, and all men and all the ages confirm it. It is called\nTruth. But the moment we cease to report and attempt to correct and\ncontrive, it is not truth.\n\nIf we consider what persons have stimulated and profited us, we shall\nperceive the superiority of the spontaneous or intuitive principle over\nthe arithmetical or logical. The first contains the second, but virtual\nand latent. We want in every man a long logic; we cannot pardon the\nabsence of it, but it must not be spoken. Logic is the procession or\nproportionate unfolding of the intuition; but its virtue is as silent\nmethod; the moment it would appear as propositions and have a separate\nvalue it is worthless.\n\nIn every man's mind, some images, words and facts remain, without effort\non his part to imprint them, which others forget, and afterwards these\nillustrate to him important laws. All our progress is an unfolding, like\nthe vegetable bud. You have first an instinct, then an opinion, then a\nknowledge, as the plant has root, bud and fruit. Trust the instinct to\nthe end, though you can render no reason. It is vain to hurry it. By\ntrusting it to the end, it shall ripen into truth and you shall know why\nyou believe.\n\nEach mind has its own method. A true man never acquires after college\nrules. What you have aggregated in a natural manner surprises and\ndelights when it is produced. For we cannot oversee each other's\nsecret. And hence the differences between men in natural endowment are\ninsignificant in comparison with their common wealth. Do you think the\nporter and the cook have no anecdotes, no experiences, no wonders for\nyou? Every body knows as much as the savant. The walls of rude minds are\nscrawled all over with facts, with thoughts. They shall one day bring a\nlantern and read the inscriptions. Every man, in the degree in which he\nhas wit and culture, finds his curiosity inflamed concerning the modes\nof living and thinking of other men, and especially of those classes\nwhose minds have not been subdued by the drill of school education.\n\nThis instinctive action never ceases in a healthy mind, but becomes\nricher and more frequent in its informations through all states of\nculture. At last comes the era of reflection, when we not only observe,\nbut take pains to observe; when we of set purpose sit down to consider\nan abstract truth; when we keep the mind's eye open whilst we converse,\nwhilst we read, whilst we act, intent to learn the secret law of some\nclass of facts.\n\nWhat is the hardest task in the world? To think. I would put myself\nin the attitude to look in the eye an abstract truth, and I cannot. I\nblench and withdraw on this side and on that. I seem to know what he\nmeant who said, No man can see God face to face and live. For example,\na man explores the basis of civil government. Let him intend his mind\nwithout respite, without rest, in one direction. His best heed long time\navails him nothing. Yet thoughts are flitting before him. We all but\napprehend, we dimly forebode the truth. We say I will walk abroad, and\nthe truth will take form and clearness to me. We go forth, but cannot\nfind it. It seems as if we needed only the stillness and composed\nattitude of the library to seize the thought. But we come in, and are as\nfar from it as at first. Then, in a moment, and unannounced, the truth\nappears. A certain wandering light appears, and is the distinction, the\nprinciple, we wanted. But the oracle comes because we had previously\nlaid siege to the shrine. It seems as if the law of the intellect\nresembled that law of nature by which we now inspire, now expire the\nbreath; by which the heart now draws in, then hurls out the blood,--the\nlaw of undulation. So now you must labor with your brains, and now you\nmust forbear your activity and see what the great Soul showeth.\n\nThe immortality of man is as legitimately preached from the\nintellections as from the moral volitions. Every intellection is mainly\nprospective. Its present value is its least. Inspect what delights\nyou in Plutarch, in Shakspeare, in Cervantes. Each truth that a writer\nacquires is a lantern, which he turns full on what facts and thoughts\nlay already in his mind, and behold, all the mats and rubbish which had\nlittered his garret become precious. Every trivial fact in his private\nbiography becomes an illustration of this new principle, revisits the\nday, and delights all men by its piquancy and new charm. Men say, Where\ndid he get this? and think there was something divine in his life. But\nno; they have myriads of facts just as good, would they only get a lamp\nto ransack their attics withal.\n\nWe are all wise. The difference between persons is not in wisdom but in\nart. I knew, in an academical club, a person who always deferred to\nme; who, seeing my whim for writing, fancied that my experiences had\nsomewhat superior; whilst I saw that his experiences were as good as\nmine. Give them to me and I would make the same use of them. He held the\nold; he holds the new; I had the habit of tacking together the old and\nthe new which he did not use to exercise. This may hold in the great\nexamples. Perhaps if we should meet Shakspeare we should not be\nconscious of any steep inferiority; no, but of a great equality,--only\nthat he possessed a strange skill of using, of classifying, his facts,\nwhich we lacked. For notwithstanding our utter incapacity to produce\nanything like Hamlet and Othello, see the perfect reception this wit and\nimmense knowledge of life and liquid eloquence find in us all.\n\nIf you gather apples in the sunshine, or make hay, or hoe corn, and then\nretire within doors and shut your eyes and press them with your hand,\nyou shall still see apples hanging in the bright light with boughs and\nleaves thereto, or the tasselled grass, or the corn-flags, and this for\nfive or six hours afterwards. There lie the impressions on the retentive\norgan, though you knew it not. So lies the whole series of natural\nimages with which your life has made you acquainted, in your memory,\nthough you know it not; and a thrill of passion flashes light on their\ndark chamber, and the active power seizes instantly the fit image, as\nthe word of its momentary thought.\n\nIt is long ere we discover how rich we are. Our history, we are sure,\nis quite tame: we have nothing to write, nothing to infer. But our wiser\nyears still run back to the despised recollections of childhood, and\nalways we are fishing up some wonderful article out of that pond; until\nby and by we begin to suspect that the biography of the one foolish\nperson we know is, in reality, nothing less than the miniature\nparaphrase of the hundred volumes of the Universal History.\n\nIn the intellect constructive, which we popularly designate by the word\nGenius, we observe the same balance of two elements as in intellect\nreceptive. The constructive intellect produces thoughts, sentences,\npoems, plans, designs, systems. It is the generation of the mind, the\nmarriage of thought with nature. To genius must always go two gifts, the\nthought and the publication. The first is revelation, always a\nmiracle, which no frequency of occurrence or incessant study can ever\nfamiliarize, but which must always leave the inquirer stupid with\nwonder. It is the advent of truth into the world, a form of thought\nnow for the first time bursting into the universe, a child of the old\neternal soul, a piece of genuine and immeasurable greatness. It seems,\nfor the time, to inherit all that has yet existed and to dictate to\nthe unborn. It affects every thought of man and goes to fashion every\ninstitution. But to make it available it needs a vehicle or art by which\nit is conveyed to men. To be communicable it must become picture or\nsensible object. We must learn the language of facts. The most wonderful\ninspirations die with their subject if he has no hand to paint them to\nthe senses. The ray of light passes invisible through space and only\nwhen it falls on an object is it seen. When the spiritual energy is\ndirected on something outward, then it is a thought. The relation\nbetween it and you first makes you, the value of you, apparent to me.\nThe rich inventive genius of the painter must be smothered and lost\nfor want of the power of drawing, and in our happy hours we should be\ninexhaustible poets if once we could break through the silence into\nadequate rhyme. As all men have some access to primary truth, so all\nhave some art or power of communication in their head, but only in the\nartist does it descend into the hand. There is an inequality, whose laws\nwe do not yet know, between two men and between two moments of the same\nman, in respect to this faculty. In common hours we have the same facts\nas in the uncommon or inspired, but they do not sit for their portraits;\nthey are not detached, but lie in a web. The thought of genius is\nspontaneous; but the power of picture or expression, in the most\nenriched and flowing nature, implies a mixture of will, a certain\ncontrol over the spontaneous states, without which no production is\npossible. It is a conversion of all nature into the rhetoric of thought,\nunder the eye of judgment, with a strenuous exercise of choice. And yet\nthe imaginative vocabulary seems to be spontaneous also. It does not\nflow from experience only or mainly, but from a richer source. Not by\nany conscious imitation of particular forms are the grand strokes of the\npainter executed, but by repairing to the fountain-head of all forms in\nhis mind. Who is the first drawing-master? Without instruction we know\nvery well the ideal of the human form. A child knows if an arm or a leg\nbe distorted in a picture; if the attitude be natural or grand or mean;\nthough he has never received any instruction in drawing or heard any\nconversation on the subject, nor can himself draw with correctness a\nsingle feature. A good form strikes all eyes pleasantly, long before\nthey have any science on the subject, and a beautiful face sets twenty\nhearts in palpitation, prior to all consideration of the mechanical\nproportions of the features and head. We may owe to dreams some light\non the fountain of this skill; for as soon as we let our will go and let\nthe unconscious states ensue, see what cunning draughtsmen we are! We\nentertain ourselves with wonderful forms of men, of women, of animals,\nof gardens, of woods and of monsters, and the mystic pencil wherewith we\nthen draw has no awkwardness or inexperience, no meagreness or poverty;\nit can design well and group well; its composition is full of art, its\ncolors are well laid on and the whole canvas which it paints is lifelike\nand apt to touch us with terror, with tenderness, with desire and with\ngrief. Neither are the artist's copies from experience ever mere copies,\nbut always touched and softened by tints from this ideal domain.\n\nThe conditions essential to a constructive mind do not appear to be\nso often combined but that a good sentence or verse remains fresh and\nmemorable for a long time. Yet when we write with ease and come out into\nthe free air of thought, we seem to be assured that nothing is easier\nthan to continue this communication at pleasure. Up, down, around, the\nkingdom of thought has no inclosures, but the Muse makes us free of her\ncity. Well, the world has a million writers. One would think then that\ngood thought would be as familiar as air and water, and the gifts of\neach new hour would exclude the last. Yet we can count all our good\nbooks; nay, I remember any beautiful verse for twenty years. It is true\nthat the discerning intellect of the world is always much in advance of\nthe creative, so that there are many competent judges of the best\nbook, and few writers of the best books. But some of the conditions of\nintellectual construction are of rare occurrence. The intellect is a\nwhole and demands integrity in every work. This is resisted equally by\na man's devotion to a single thought and by his ambition to combine too\nmany.\n\nTruth is our element of life, yet if a man fasten his attention on a\nsingle aspect of truth and apply himself to that alone for a long\ntime, the truth becomes distorted and not itself but falsehood; herein\nresembling the air, which is our natural element, and the breath of\nour nostrils, but if a stream of the same be directed on the body for\na time, it causes cold, fever, and even death. How wearisome the\ngrammarian, the phrenologist, the political or religious fanatic, or\nindeed any possessed mortal whose balance is lost by the exaggeration\nof a single topic. It is incipient insanity. Every thought is a prison\nalso. I cannot see what you see, because I am caught up by a strong\nwind and blown so far in one direction that I am out of the hoop of your\nhorizon.\n\nIs it any better if the student, to avoid this offence, and to\nliberalize himself, aims to make a mechanical whole of history, or\nscience, or philosophy, by a numerical addition of all the facts that\nfall within his vision? The world refuses to be analyzed by addition and\nsubtraction. When we are young we spend much time and pains in filling\nour note-books with all definitions of Religion, Love, Poetry, Politics,\nArt, in the hope that in the course of a few years we shall have\ncondensed into our encyclopaedia the net value of all the theories at\nwhich the world has yet arrived. But year after year our tables get\nno completeness, and at last we discover that our curve is a parabola,\nwhose arcs will never meet.\n\nNeither by detachment neither by aggregation is the integrity of the\nintellect transmitted to its works, but by a vigilance which brings the\nintellect in its greatness and best state to operate every moment. It\nmust have the same wholeness which nature has. Although no diligence can\nrebuild the universe in a model by the best accumulation or disposition\nof details, yet does the world reappear in miniature in every event,\nso that all the laws of nature may be read in the smallest fact. The\nintellect must have the like perfection in its apprehension and in its\nworks. For this reason, an index or mercury of intellectual proficiency\nis the perception of identity. We talk with accomplished persons who\nappear to be strangers in nature. The cloud, the tree, the turf, the\nbird are not theirs, have nothing of them; the world is only their\nlodging and table. But the poet, whose verses are to be spheral\nand complete, is one whom Nature cannot deceive, whatsoever face of\nstrangeness she may put on. He feels a strict consanguinity, and detects\nmore likeness than variety in all her changes. We are stung by the\ndesire for new thought; but when we receive a new thought it is only the\nold thought with a new face, and though we make it our own we instantly\ncrave another; we are not really enriched. For the truth was in us\nbefore it was reflected to us from natural objects; and the profound\ngenius will cast the likeness of all creatures into every product of his\nwit.\n\nBut if the constructive powers are rare and it is given to few men to\nbe poets, yet every man is a receiver of this descending holy ghost,\nand may well study the laws of its influx. Exactly parallel is the whole\nrule of intellectual duty to the rule of moral duty. A self-denial\nno less austere than the saint's is demanded of the scholar. He must\nworship truth, and forego all things for that, and choose defeat and\npain, so that his treasure in thought is thereby augmented.\n\nGod offers to every mind its choice between truth and repose. Take which\nyou please,--you can never have both. Between these, as a pendulum, man\noscillates. He in whom the love of repose predominates will accept\nthe first creed, the first philosophy, the first political party\nhe meets,--most likely his father's. He gets rest, commodity, and\nreputation; but he shuts the door of truth. He in whom the love of truth\npredominates will keep himself aloof from all moorings, and afloat. He\nwill abstain from dogmatism, and recognize all the opposite negations\nbetween which, as walls, his being is swung. He submits to the\ninconvenience of suspense and imperfect opinion, but he is a candidate\nfor truth, as the other is not, and respects the highest law of his\nbeing.\n\nThe circle of the green earth he must measure with his shoes to find the\nman who can yield him truth. He shall then know that there is somewhat\nmore blessed and great in hearing than in speaking. Happy is the hearing\nman; unhappy the speaking man. As long as I hear truth I am bathed by a\nbeautiful element and am not conscious of any limits to my nature. The\nsuggestions are thousandfold that I hear and see. The waters of the\ngreat deep have ingress and egress to the soul. But if I speak, I\ndefine, I confine and am less. When Socrates speaks, Lysis and Menexenus\nare afflicted by no shame that they do not speak. They also are good.\nHe likewise defers to them, loves them, whilst he speaks. Because a true\nand natural man contains and is the same truth which an eloquent man\narticulates; but in the eloquent man, because he can articulate it,\nit seems something the less to reside, and he turns to these silent\nbeautiful with the more inclination and respect. The ancient sentence\nsaid, Let us be silent, for so are the gods. Silence is a solvent that\ndestroys personality, and gives us leave to be great and universal.\nEvery man's progress is through a succession of teachers, each of whom\nseems at the time to have a superlative influence, but it at last gives\nplace to a new. Frankly let him accept it all. Jesus says, Leave father,\nmother, house and lands, and follow me. Who leaves all, receives more.\nThis is as true intellectually as morally. Each new mind we approach\nseems to require an abdication of all our past and present possessions.\nA new doctrine seems at first a subversion of all our opinions, tastes,\nand manner of living. Such has Swedenborg, such has Kant, such has\nColeridge, such has Hegel or his interpreter Cousin seemed to many young\nmen in this country. Take thankfully and heartily all they can give.\nExhaust them, wrestle with them, let them not go until their blessing be\nwon, and after a short season the dismay will be overpast, the excess of\ninfluence withdrawn, and they will be no longer an alarming meteor, but\none more bright star shining serenely in your heaven and blending its\nlight with all your day.\n\nBut whilst he gives himself up unreservedly to that which draws him,\nbecause that is his own, he is to refuse himself to that which draws him\nnot, whatsoever fame and authority may attend it, because it is not\nhis own. Entire self-reliance belongs to the intellect. One soul is a\ncounterpoise of all souls, as a capillary column of water is a balance\nfor the sea. It must treat things and books and sovereign genius as\nitself also a sovereign. If Aeschylus be that man he is taken for, he\nhas not yet done his office when he has educated the learned of Europe\nfor a thousand years. He is now to approve himself a master of delight\nto me also. If he cannot do that, all his fame shall avail him nothing\nwith me. I were a fool not to sacrifice a thousand Aeschyluses to my\nintellectual integrity. Especially take the same ground in regard to\nabstract truth, the science of the mind. The Bacon, the Spinoza, the\nHume, Schelling, Kant, or whosoever propounds to you a philosophy of\nthe mind, is only a more or less awkward translator of things in\nyour consciousness which you have also your way of seeing, perhaps of\ndenominating. Say then, instead of too timidly poring into his\nobscure sense, that he has not succeeded in rendering back to you your\nconsciousness. He has not succeeded; now let another try. If Plato\ncannot, perhaps Spinoza will. If Spinoza cannot, then perhaps Kant.\nAnyhow, when at last it is done, you will find it is no recondite, but a\nsimple, natural, common state which the writer restores to you.\n\nBut let us end these didactics. I will not, though the subject might\nprovoke it, speak to the open question between Truth and Love. I\nshall not presume to interfere in the old politics of the skies;--\"The\ncherubim know most; the seraphim love most.\" The gods shall settle\ntheir own quarrels. But I cannot recite, even thus rudely, laws of the\nintellect, without remembering that lofty and sequestered class of men\nwho have been its prophets and oracles, the high-priesthood of the pure\nreason, the Trismegisti, the expounders of the principles of thought\nfrom age to age. When at long intervals we turn over their abstruse\npages, wonderful seems the calm and grand air of these few, these\ngreat spiritual lords who have walked in the world,--these of the\nold religion,--dwelling in a worship which makes the sanctities of\nChristianity look parvenues and popular; for \"persuasion is in soul, but\nnecessity is in intellect.\" This band of grandees, Hermes, Heraclitus,\nEmpedocles, Plato, Plotinus, Olympiodorus, Proclus, Synesius and\nthe rest, have somewhat so vast in their logic, so primary in their\nthinking, that it seems antecedent to all the ordinary distinctions of\nrhetoric and literature, and to be at once poetry and music and dancing\nand astronomy and mathematics. I am present at the sowing of the seed of\nthe world. With a geometry of sunbeams the soul lays the foundations of\nnature. The truth and grandeur of their thought is proved by its scope\nand applicability, for it commands the entire schedule and inventory of\nthings for its illustration. But what marks its elevation and has even\na comic look to us, is the innocent serenity with which these babe-like\nJupiters sit in their clouds, and from age to age prattle to each other\nand to no contemporary. Well assured that their speech is intelligible\nand the most natural thing in the world, they add thesis to thesis,\nwithout a moment's heed of the universal astonishment of the human race\nbelow, who do not comprehend their plainest argument; nor do they\never relent so much as to insert a popular or explaining sentence,\nnor testify the least displeasure or petulance at the dulness of their\namazed auditory. The angels are so enamored of the language that is\nspoken in heaven that they will not distort their lips with the hissing\nand unmusical dialects of men, but speak their own, whether there be any\nwho understand it or not.\n\n*****\n\n\n\n     ART.\n\n     GIVE to barrows trays and pans\n     Grace and glimmer of romance,\n     Bring the moonlight into noon\n     Hid in gleaming piles of stone;\n     On the city's paved street\n     Plant gardens lined with lilac sweet,\n     Let spouting fountains cool the air,\n     Singing in the sun-baked square.\n     Let statue, picture, park and hall,\n     Ballad, flag and festival,\n     The past restore, the day adorn\n     And make each morrow a new morn\n     So shall the drudge in dusty frock\n     Spy behind the city clock\n     Retinues of airy kings,\n     Skirts of angels, starry wings,\n     His fathers shining in bright fables,\n     His children fed at heavenly tables.\n     'Tis the privilege of Art\n     Thus to play its cheerful part,\n     Man in Earth to acclimate\n     And bend the exile to his fate,\n     And, moulded of one element\n     With the days and firmament,\n     Teach him on these as stairs to climb\n     And live on even terms with Time;\n     Whilst upper life the slender rill\n     Of human sense doth overfill.\n\n\n\n\nXII. ART.\n\nBecause the soul is progressive, it never quite repeats itself, but\nin every act attempts the production of a new and fairer whole. This\nappears in works both of the useful and the fine arts, if we employ the\npopular distinction of works according to their aim either at use or\nbeauty. Thus in our fine arts, not imitation but creation is the aim. In\nlandscapes the painter should give the suggestion of a fairer creation\nthan we know. The details, the prose of nature he should omit and give\nus only the spirit and splendor. He should know that the landscape has\nbeauty for his eye because it expresses a thought which is to him good;\nand this because the same power which sees through his eyes is seen in\nthat spectacle; and he will come to value the expression of nature and\nnot nature itself, and so exalt in his copy the features that please\nhim. He will give the gloom of gloom and the sunshine of sunshine. In a\nportrait he must inscribe the character and not the features, and must\nesteem the man who sits to him as himself only an imperfect picture or\nlikeness of the aspiring original within.\n\nWhat is that abridgment and selection we observe in all spiritual\nactivity, but itself the creative impulse? for it is the inlet of that\nhigher illumination which teaches to convey a larger sense by simpler\nsymbols. What is a man but nature's finer success in self-explication?\nWhat is a man but a finer and compacter landscape than the horizon\nfigures,--nature's eclecticism? and what is his speech, his love of\npainting, love of nature, but a still finer success,--all the weary\nmiles and tons of space and bulk left out, and the spirit or moral of\nit contracted into a musical word, or the most cunning stroke of the\npencil?\n\nBut the artist must employ the symbols in use in his day and nation\nto convey his enlarged sense to his fellow-men. Thus the new in art\nis always formed out of the old. The Genius of the Hour sets his\nineffaceable seal on the work and gives it an inexpressible charm\nfor the imagination. As far as the spiritual character of the period\noverpowers the artist and finds expression in his work, so far it will\nretain a certain grandeur, and will represent to future beholders the\nUnknown, the Inevitable, the Divine. No man can quite exclude this\nelement of Necessity from his labor. No man can quite emancipate himself\nfrom his age and country, or produce a model in which the education,\nthe religion, the politics, usages and arts of his times shall have no\nshare. Though he were never so original, never so wilful and fantastic,\nhe cannot wipe out of his work every trace of the thoughts amidst which\nit grew. The very avoidance betrays the usage he avoids. Above his will\nand out of his sight he is necessitated by the air he breathes and the\nidea on which he and his contemporaries live and toil, to share the\nmanner of his times, without knowing what that manner is. Now that which\nis inevitable in the work has a higher charm than individual talent can\never give, inasmuch as the artist's pen or chisel seems to have been\nheld and guided by a gigantic hand to inscribe a line in the history\nof the human race. This circumstance gives a value to the Egyptian\nhieroglyphics, to the Indian, Chinese and Mexican idols, however gross\nand shapeless. They denote the height of the human soul in that hour,\nand were not fantastic, but sprung from a necessity as deep as the\nworld. Shall I now add that the whole extant product of the plastic\narts has herein its highest value, as history; as a stroke drawn in\nthe portrait of that fate, perfect and beautiful, according to whose\nordinations all beings advance to their beatitude?\n\nThus, historically viewed, it has been the office of art to educate the\nperception of beauty. We are immersed in beauty, but our eyes have no\nclear vision. It needs, by the exhibition of single traits, to assist\nand lead the dormant taste. We carve and paint, or we behold what is\ncarved and painted, as students of the mystery of Form. The virtue of\nart lies in detachment, in sequestering one object from the embarrassing\nvariety. Until one thing comes out from the connection of things, there\ncan be enjoyment, contemplation, but no thought. Our happiness and\nunhappiness are unproductive. The infant lies in a pleasing trance, but\nhis individual character and his practical power depend on his daily\nprogress in the separation of things, and dealing with one at a time.\nLove and all the passions concentrate all existence around a single\nform. It is the habit of certain minds to give an all-excluding fulness\nto the object, the thought, the word, they alight upon, and to make\nthat for the time the deputy of the world. These are the artists, the\norators, the leaders of society. The power to detach and to magnify by\ndetaching is the essence of rhetoric in the hands of the orator and\nthe poet. This rhetoric, or power to fix the momentary eminency of an\nobject,--so remarkable in Burke, in Byron, in Carlyle,--the painter and\nsculptor exhibit in color and in stone. The power depends on the depth\nof the artist's insight of that object he contemplates. For every object\nhas its roots in central nature, and may of course be so exhibited to us\nas to represent the world. Therefore each work of genius is the tyrant\nof the hour And concentrates attention on itself. For the time, it is\nthe only thing worth naming to do that,--be it a sonnet, an opera, a\nlandscape, a statue, an oration, the plan of a temple, of a campaign, or\nof a voyage of discovery. Presently we pass to some other object, which\nrounds itself into a whole as did the first; for example a well-laid\ngarden; and nothing seems worth doing but the laying out of gardens. I\nshould think fire the best thing in the world, if I were not acquainted\nwith air, and water, and earth. For it is the right and property of\nall natural objects, of all genuine talents, of all native properties\nwhatsoever, to be for their moment the top of the world. A squirrel\nleaping from bough to bough and making the Wood but one wide tree\nfor his pleasure, fills the eye not less than a lion,--is beautiful,\nself-sufficing, and stands then and there for nature. A good ballad\ndraws my ear and heart whilst I listen, as much as an epic has done\nbefore. A dog, drawn by a master, or a litter of pigs, satisfies and is\na reality not less than the frescoes of Angelo. From this succession\nof excellent objects we learn at last the immensity of the world,\nthe opulence of human nature, which can run out to infinitude in any\ndirection. But I also learn that what astonished and fascinated me in\nthe first work astonished me in the second work also; that excellence of\nall things is one.\n\nThe office of painting and sculpture seems to be merely initial. The\nbest pictures can easily tell us their last secret. The best pictures\nare rude draughts of a few of the miraculous dots and lines and dyes\nwhich make up the ever-changing \"landscape with figures\" amidst which\nwe dwell. Painting seems to be to the eye what dancing is to the limbs.\nWhen that has educated the frame to self-possession, to nimbleness, to\ngrace, the steps of the dancing-master are better forgotten; so painting\nteaches me the splendor of color and the expression of form, and as\nI see many pictures and higher genius in the art, I see the boundless\nopulence of the pencil, the indifferency in which the artist stands free\nto choose out of the possible forms. If he can draw every thing, why\ndraw any thing? and then is my eye opened to the eternal picture which\nnature paints in the street, with moving men and children, beggars and\nfine ladies, draped in red and green and blue and gray; long-haired,\ngrizzled, white-faced, black-faced, wrinkled, giant, dwarf, expanded,\nelfish,--capped and based by heaven, earth and sea.\n\nA gallery of sculpture teaches more austerely the same lesson. As\npicture teaches the coloring, so sculpture the anatomy of form. When\nI have seen fine statues and afterwards enter a public assembly, I\nunderstand well what he meant who said, \"When I have been reading Homer,\nall men look like giants.\" I too see that painting and sculpture are\ngymnastics of the eye, its training to the niceties and curiosities of\nits function. There is no statue like this living man, with his infinite\nadvantage over all ideal sculpture, of perpetual variety. What a gallery\nof art have I here! No mannerist made these varied groups and diverse\noriginal single figures. Here is the artist himself improvising, grim\nand glad, at his block. Now one thought strikes him, now another, and\nwith each moment he alters the whole air, attitude and expression of his\nclay. Away with your nonsense of oil and easels, of marble and chisels;\nexcept to open your eyes to the masteries of eternal art, they are\nhypocritical rubbish.\n\nThe reference of all production at last to an aboriginal Power explains\nthe traits common to all works of the highest art,--that they are\nuniversally intelligible; that they restore to us the simplest states\nof mind, and are religious. Since what skill is therein shown is the\nreappearance of the original soul, a jet of pure light, it should\nproduce a similar impression to that made by natural objects. In happy\nhours, nature appears to us one with art; art perfected,--the work of\ngenius. And the individual, in whom simple tastes and susceptibility to\nall the great human influences overpower the accidents of a local and\nspecial culture, is the best critic of art. Though we travel the world\nover to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us, or we find it not.\nThe best of beauty is a finer charm than skill in surfaces, in outlines,\nor rules of art can ever teach, namely a radiation from the work of art\nof human character,--a wonderful expression through stone, or canvas, or\nmusical sound, of the deepest and simplest attributes of our nature,\nand therefore most intelligible at last to those souls which have these\nattributes. In the sculptures of the Greeks, in the masonry of the\nRomans, and in the pictures of the Tuscan and Venetian masters, the\nhighest charm is the universal language they speak. A confession of\nmoral nature, of purity, love, and hope, breathes from them all. That\nwhich we carry to them, the same we bring back more fairly illustrated\nin the memory. The traveller who visits the Vatican, and passes from\nchamber to chamber through galleries of statues, vases, sarcophagi and\ncandelabra, through all forms of beauty cut in the richest materials,\nis in danger of forgetting the simplicity of the principles out of which\nthey all sprung, and that they had their origin from thoughts and laws\nin his own breast. He studies the technical rules on these wonderful\nremains, but forgets that these works were not always thus constellated;\nthat they are the contributions of many ages and many countries; that\neach came out of the solitary workshop of one artist, who toiled perhaps\nin ignorance of the existence of other sculpture, created his work\nwithout other model save life, household life, and the sweet and smart\nof personal relations, of beating hearts, and meeting eyes; of poverty\nand necessity and hope and fear. These were his inspirations, and these\nare the effects he carries home to your heart and mind. In proportion\nto his force, the artist will find in his work an outlet for his proper\ncharacter. He must not be in any manner pinched or hindered by his\nmaterial, but through his necessity of imparting himself the adamant\nwill be wax in his hands, and will allow an adequate communication of\nhimself, in his full stature and proportion. He need not cumber himself\nwith a conventional nature and culture, nor ask what is the mode in\nRome or in Paris, but that house and weather and manner of living which\npoverty and the fate of birth have made at once so odious and so dear,\nin the gray unpainted wood cabin, on the corner of a New Hampshire farm,\nor in the log-hut of the backwoods, or in the narrow lodging where he\nhas endured the constraints and seeming of a city poverty, will serve\nas well as any other condition as the symbol of a thought which pours\nitself indifferently through all.\n\nI remember when in my younger days I had heard of the wonders of Italian\npainting, I fancied the great pictures would be great strangers; some\nsurprising combination of color and form; a foreign wonder, barbaric\npearl and gold, like the spontoons and standards of the militia, which\nplay such pranks in the eyes and imaginations of school-boys. I was to\nsee and acquire I knew not what. When I came at last to Rome and saw\nwith eyes the pictures, I found that genius left to novices the gay and\nfantastic and ostentatious, and itself pierced directly to the simple\nand true; that it was familiar and sincere; that it was the old, eternal\nfact I had met already in so many forms,--unto which I lived; that it\nwas the plain you and me I knew so well,--had left at home in so many\nconversations. I had the same experience already in a church at Naples.\nThere I saw that nothing was changed with me but the place, and said\nto myself--'Thou foolish child, hast thou come out hither, over four\nthousand miles of salt water, to find that which was perfect to thee\nthere at home?' That fact I saw again in the Academmia at Naples, in\nthe chambers of sculpture, and yet again when I came to Rome and to the\npaintings of Raphael, Angelo, Sacchi, Titian, and Leonardo da Vinci.\n\"What, old mole! workest thou in the earth so fast?\" It had travelled\nby my side; that which I fancied I had left in Boston was here in\nthe Vatican, and again at Milan and at Paris, and made all travelling\nridiculous as a treadmill. I now require this of all pictures, that\nthey domesticate me, not that they dazzle me. Pictures must not be too\npicturesque. Nothing astonishes men so much as common-sense and plain\ndealing. All great actions have been simple, and all great pictures are.\n\nThe Transfiguration, by Raphael, is an eminent example of this peculiar\nmerit. A calm benignant beauty shines over all this picture, and goes\ndirectly to the heart. It seems almost to call you by name. The sweet\nand sublime face of Jesus is beyond praise, yet how it disappoints all\nflorid expectations! This familiar, simple, home-speaking countenance is\nas if one should meet a friend. The knowledge of picture-dealers has its\nvalue, but listen not to their criticism when your heart is touched by\ngenius. It was not painted for them, it was painted for you; for such as\nhad eyes capable of being touched by simplicity and lofty emotions.\n\nYet when we have said all our fine things about the arts, we must\nend with a frank confession, that the arts, as we know them, are but\ninitial. Our best praise is given to what they aimed and promised, not\nto the actual result. He has conceived meanly of the resources of man,\nwho believes that the best age of production is past. The real value\nof the Iliad or the Transfiguration is as signs of power; billows or\nripples they are of the stream of tendency; tokens of the everlasting\neffort to produce, which even in its worst estate the soul betrays. Art\nhas not yet come to its maturity if it do not put itself abreast with\nthe most potent influences of the world, if it is not practical and\nmoral, if it do not stand in connection with the conscience, if it do\nnot make the poor and uncultivated feel that it addresses them with a\nvoice of lofty cheer. There is higher work for Art than the arts. They\nare abortive births of an imperfect or vitiated instinct. Art is\nthe need to create; but in its essence, immense and universal, it is\nimpatient of working with lame or tied hands, and of making cripples and\nmonsters, such as all pictures and statues are. Nothing less than the\ncreation of man and nature is its end. A man should find in it an outlet\nfor his whole energy. He may paint and carve only as long as he can do\nthat. Art should exhilarate, and throw down the walls of circumstance\non every side, awakening in the beholder the same sense of universal\nrelation and power which the work evinced in the artist, and its highest\neffect is to make new artists.\n\nAlready History is old enough to witness the old age and disappearance\nof particular arts. The art of sculpture is long ago perished to any\nreal effect. It was originally a useful art, a mode of writing, a\nsavage's record of gratitude or devotion, and among a people possessed\nof a wonderful perception of form this childish carving was refined to\nthe utmost splendor of effect. But it is the game of a rude and youthful\npeople, and not the manly labor of a wise and spiritual nation. Under an\noak-tree loaded with leaves and nuts, under a sky full of eternal eyes,\nI stand in a thoroughfare; but in the works of our plastic arts and\nespecially of sculpture, creation is driven into a corner. I cannot hide\nfrom myself that there is a certain appearance of paltriness, as of toys\nand the trumpery of a theatre, in sculpture. Nature transcends all our\nmoods of thought, and its secret we do not yet find. But the gallery\nstands at the mercy of our moods, and there is a moment when it becomes\nfrivolous. I do not wonder that Newton, with an attention habitually\nengaged on the paths of planets and suns, should have wondered what the\nEarl of Pembroke found to admire in \"stone dolls.\" Sculpture may serve\nto teach the pupil how deep is the secret of form, how purely the spirit\ncan translate its meanings into that eloquent dialect. But the statue\nwill look cold and false before that new activity which needs to roll\nthrough all things, and is impatient of counterfeits and things not\nalive. Picture and sculpture are the celebrations and festivities of\nform. But true art is never fixed, but always flowing. The sweetest\nmusic is not in the oratorio, but in the human voice when it speaks from\nits instant life tones of tenderness, truth, or courage. The oratorio\nhas already lost its relation to the morning, to the sun, and the earth,\nbut that persuading voice is in tune with these. All works of art should\nnot be detached, but extempore performances. A great man is a new statue\nin every attitude and action. A beautiful woman is a picture which\ndrives all beholders nobly mad. Life may be lyric or epic, as well as a\npoem or a romance.\n\nA true announcement of the law of creation, if a man were found worthy\nto declare it, would carry art up into the kingdom of nature, and\ndestroy its separate and contrasted existence. The fountains of\ninvention and beauty in modern society are all but dried up. A popular\nnovel, a theatre, or a ball-room makes us feel that we are all paupers\nin the alms-house of this world, without dignity, without skill or\nindustry. Art is as poor and low. The old tragic Necessity, which lowers\non the brows even of the Venuses and the Cupids of the antique, and\nfurnishes the sole apology for the intrusion of such anomalous figures\ninto nature,--namely, that they were inevitable; that the artist was\ndrunk with a passion for form which he could not resist, and which\nvented itself in these fine extravagances,--no longer dignifies the\nchisel or the pencil. But the artist and the connoisseur now seek in art\nthe exhibition of their talent, or an asylum from the evils of life.\nMen are not well pleased with the figure they make in their own\nimaginations, and they flee to art, and convey their better sense in\nan oratorio, a statue, or a picture. Art makes the same effort which\na sensual prosperity makes; namely to detach the beautiful from the\nuseful, to do up the work as unavoidable, and, hating it, pass on to\nenjoyment. These solaces and compensations, this division of beauty from\nuse, the laws of nature do not permit. As soon as beauty is sought, not\nfrom religion and love but for pleasure, it degrades the seeker. High\nbeauty is no longer attainable by him in canvas or in stone, in sound,\nor in lyrical construction; an effeminate, prudent, sickly beauty, which\nis not beauty, is all that can be formed; for the hand can never execute\nany thing higher than the character can inspire.\n\nThe art that thus separates is itself first separated. Art must not be\na superficial talent, but must begin farther back in man. Now men do not\nsee nature to be beautiful, and they go to make a statue which shall\nbe. They abhor men as tasteless, dull, and inconvertible, and console\nthemselves with color-bags and blocks of marble. They reject life as\nprosaic, and create a death which they call poetic. They despatch the\nday's weary chores, and fly to voluptuous reveries. They eat and drink,\nthat they may afterwards execute the ideal. Thus is art vilified; the\nname conveys to the mind its secondary and bad senses; it stands in the\nimagination as somewhat contrary to nature, and struck with death from\nthe first. Would it not be better to begin higher up,--to serve the\nideal before they eat and drink; to serve the ideal in eating and\ndrinking, in drawing the breath, and in the functions of life? Beauty\nmust come back to the useful arts, and the distinction between the fine\nand the useful arts be forgotten. If history were truly told, if life\nwere nobly spent, it would be no longer easy or possible to distinguish\nthe one from the other. In nature, all is useful, all is beautiful. It\nis therefore beautiful because it is alive, moving, reproductive; it\nis therefore useful because it is symmetrical and fair. Beauty will\nnot come at the call of a legislature, nor will it repeat in England or\nAmerica its history in Greece. It will come, as always, unannounced, and\nspring up between the feet of brave and earnest men. It is in vain that\nwe look for genius to reiterate its miracles in the old arts; it is its\ninstinct to find beauty and holiness in new and necessary facts, in the\nfield and road-side, in the shop and mill. Proceeding from a religious\nheart it will raise to a divine use the railroad, the insurance office,\nthe joint-stock company; our law, our primary assemblies, our commerce,\nthe galvanic battery, the electric jar, the prism, and the chemist's\nretort; in which we seek now only an economical use. Is not the selfish\nand even cruel aspect which belongs to our great mechanical works, to\nmills, railways, and machinery, the effect of the mercenary impulses\nwhich these works obey? When its errands are noble and adequate, a\nsteamboat bridging the Atlantic between Old and New England and arriving\nat its ports with the punctuality of a planet, is a step of man into\nharmony with nature. The boat at St. Petersburg, which plies along the\nLena by magnetism, needs little to make it sublime. When science is\nlearned in love, and its powers are wielded by love, they will appear\nthe supplements and continuations of the material creation.\n"}
