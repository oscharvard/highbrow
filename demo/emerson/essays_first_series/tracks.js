He furthers this by saying once you&#39;ve accepted that you can&#39;t do anything the problem will get worked out on its own. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, I like to take the optimist&#39;s view that people should always look out for each other and help others as much as they can. &nbsp;If everyone took the attitude of &quot;attend to your own work&quot;, then not only would we not have any social interaction, but huge relief organizations would never be funded, each person would live in their own little world. &nbsp;This brings me back to the title of &quot;Self Reliance&quot;...could that be what Emerson had invisioned all along?<\/p>\n","title":"Untitled Note","updated":1316673734301,"created":1316673734301}],"sharing":"2"},{"id":"t_63_1317092472988","visible":false,"name":"L000's Notes","user":{"uid":"63","name":"lambelau000"},"editable":false,"type":"notes","uid":"1","selected":false,"notes":[{"id":"t_63_1317092472988_01","start":47427,"stop":47630,"content":"<p>\n\tAmongst Emerson&#39;s various definitions for self, I believe that this one is the center for which all of the other ones are created from.
